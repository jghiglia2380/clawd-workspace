## Season Theme

**Magical travels to markets through time — learning about trade and cultural exchange**

The friends discover (through Mr. Mason's stories and perhaps a magical object) that they can visit markets from different times and places. Each chapter takes them to a new market setting where they learn about trade, exchange, and how different cultures approach commerce.

---

## FL Concepts to Weave In

- Origins of trade and money
- Bartering vs. currency
- Supply and demand (simple)
- Different cultures, same human needs
- Value of goods across cultures
- Specialization and division of labor
- Trust in trade relationships
- Fair exchange and negotiation

## Character Arcs (Season 2)

From the character bible:

- **Layla:** "Learns to balance adventure with planning (Frances/Mr. Mason teach patience)"
- **Riley:** "Gains confidence to share her vision (learns her ideas matter)"
- **Ellis:** "Develops confidence in his ideas (learns his caution has value)"
- **Benny:** "Learns when to be silly and when to be serious (emotional regulation)"
- **Mr. Mason:** "The world traveler who shares stories of distant places (sets up magic carpet journey)"

## Chapter Arc Ideas

*Draft — needs Justin approval*

### Act 1: Discovery (Ch 1-3)
1. **The Magic Carpet** — Mr. Mason shows them an old carpet with a story. It magically transports them to their first market (introduction to the season's mechanic)
2. **The Spice Market** — Ancient Middle Eastern bazaar. Learn about spices as valuable trade goods, bartering culture
3. **The Silk Road Stop** — Central Asian market. Concept of trade routes, goods traveling long distances

### Act 2: Exploration (Ch 4-7)
4. **The Floating Market** — Southeast Asian water market. Different forms of marketplaces, local goods
5. **The Village Fair** — Medieval European fair. Currency coins, measuring value, fair prices
6. **The Trading Post** — American frontier. Fur trade, supply/demand, what people need vs. want
7. **The Fishing Harbor** — Coastal market. Specialization (fishermen fish, bakers bake), interdependence

### Act 3: Understanding (Ch 8-10)
8. **The Street Market** — Modern developing world. Negotiation skills, fair pricing, trust
9. **The Night Market** — East Asian street food market. Small business, entrepreneurship seeds
10. **The Artisan Square** — Craftspeople market. Value of skills and handmade goods, quality

### Act 4: Return & Reflection (Ch 11-12)
11. **The Community Market** — Back home, friends decide to create their own market. Apply everything learned
12. **Market Day** — The big event. Celebration, reflection on journey, what trade really means

## Magic Mechanic

**Option A:** Mr. Mason's carpet literally transports them (fantasy)
**Option B:** Mr. Mason's stories are so vivid they "experience" them (imaginative play)
**Option C:** They find an old book/artifact that shows them visions (semi-fantasy)

*Need to decide: full fantasy or grounded in imagination?*

---

## Questions for Justin

1. How fantastical should the "travel" mechanic be? Real magic carpet or imaginative play?
2. Should markets be historically accurate or stylized/simplified?
3. Any specific cultures/regions you want to feature or avoid?
4. Continue with same 6 characters or introduce any new ones?
5. Is the Season 1 neighborhood the "home base" they return to between adventures?

---

## Reference: Season 1 Pattern

Season 1 had a clear seasonal progression (spring → summer → fall → early winter) and stayed grounded in the neighborhood. Each chapter was a self-contained adventure but contributed to the whole.

Season 2 could follow:
- Geographic progression (east to west, or ancient to modern)
- Thematic progression (simple barter → complex trade)
- Character growth progression (each friend leads a chapter matching their strength)

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize chapter arc with Justin
2. Write detailed story spines for each chapter
3. Begin scene breakdowns (20 per chapter)
