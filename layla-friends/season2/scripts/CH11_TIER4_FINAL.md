## EL MERCADO DE LOS MUERTOS

### Scene 1 (58 words)
The friends visited Frances on her comfortable front porch in the quiet late afternoon. The autumn sun was warm and golden, casting long shadows across the worn wooden boards. "We have learned so much about markets this season," said Layla thoughtfully. "Value, timing, teamwork, specialization. But something still feels missing from our plans. Like we don't understand the heart of it."

### Scene 2 (60 words)
Frances nodded with deep understanding in her wise eyes. "You have learned how markets work," she said gently. "Now you need to learn why they truly matter. The heart beneath all the trading and the numbers." She settled back in her old rocking chair with a knowing smile. "Let me tell you a story about purpose and love."

### Scene 3 (59 words)
Frances's eyes got soft and far away, seeing another time and place entirely. "When I was nine years old, my abuelita took me to Mexico for something very special," she began slowly. "We went to a market unlike any other in the world. Close your eyes with me. Smell the marigolds. Hear the prayers. Feel the love."

### Scene 4 (58 words)
The porch faded away around them like morning mist clearing in sunlight. Bright, vivid colors appeared everywhere they looked. Orange and purple and gold! They stood in a Mexican town square transformed by celebration. Flowers filled every corner and doorway, spilling from baskets and windows. This was the market before Día de los Muertos — the Day of the Dead.

### Scene 5 (60 words)
Young Frances held her grandmother's weathered, gentle hand tightly. Her eyes were wide with wonder at the overwhelming beauty surrounding her. "Abuelita, why is everything so orange?" she asked with curiosity. "That color guides them home to us, mija," said her grandmother softly, squeezing her small hand with love. "The spirits follow the brightness back to the people who remember them."

### Scene 6 (59 words)
They walked to a flower stall overflowing with magnificent, fragrant blooms. Mountains of orange marigolds called cempasúchil filled the air with their sweet, powerful, unmistakable smell. The vendor smiled warmly at Abuelita like greeting a beloved old friend. "Doña Elena! Your flowers are waiting for you, as always!" They knew each other from many years of this sacred tradition.

### Scene 7 (58 words)
Young Frances asked why they needed so many bright flowers for just one night of the year. Abuelita explained gently, kneeling down to look into her eyes at her level. "The bright color and sweet smell guide the spirits home to visit us. These are not just pretty decorations for a party. They are a path of love and memory."

### Scene 8 (60 words)
They visited a woman carefully crafting sugar skulls called calaveras at her artisan stall. She decorated each one with names written in colorful icing with steady, practiced hands. "Tell me their names," she said kindly, looking up with gentle eyes. "I write them here so they know we remember and love them always." Abuelita whispered three precious names that meant everything to her.

### Scene 9 (59 words)
Young Frances suddenly understood something profound about what she was seeing. These were not candy treats to eat casually. They were tributes to honor the dead with beauty and reverent care. Each decorated skull represented someone who had passed away from this world. Someone's grandmother. Someone's child. Someone deeply loved and forever missed. She touched one gently with new reverence.

### Scene 10 (58 words)
They bought tall candles for the ofrenda they would build together at home. "Each flame is a prayer," the candle vendor explained with quiet reverence in her voice. "Your prayer is the light that guides them through the dark night to find you." Young Frances listened carefully, understanding that even the smallest flame could hold powerful, sacred meaning.

### Scene 11 (60 words)
They bought pan de muerto from the warm bakery that smelled wonderfully like sugar and yeast and cinnamon. This special bread was shaped with bone patterns on top to honor the departed. The kind baker gave young Frances a small taste from a fresh loaf. It was sweet and wonderful on her tongue. "We bake with our hands what we carry in our hearts."

### Scene 12 (59 words)
As they walked through the crowded, joyful market, Abuelita shared something deeply important with her granddaughter. "Everything here was made by hand with love and intention," she explained meaningfully. "That is what gives these things their special power beyond any price. The hands that made them put their hearts inside every piece, every petal, every brushstroke, every ounce of sugar."

### Scene 13 (58 words)
Young Frances helped pick papel picado — colorful cut paper banners with intricate designs that fluttered in the breeze. She also chose fabric for their home ofrenda with great care. She picked purple and gold specifically and purposefully. "These were Abuelo's favorite colors," she said with determination. "I want him to see them and know we remember him always."

### Scene 14 (60 words)
Later that evening, the whole family built their ofrenda together as they did every single year. They placed flowers, candles, photos, decorated skulls, and bread with loving care. Everyone helped, from the oldest grandmother to the youngest child. They were not creating this for money or for praise. They were creating it purely for love — the greatest value of all.

### Scene 15 (59 words)
The memory faded softly like candlelight dimming at dawn. Frances was back on her porch, and the friends sat around her in thoughtful, moved silence. Some things are not made to be sold for any amount of money. They are made to mean something important. To remember those we've lost. To honor those we love. To keep love alive.

### Scene 16 (58 words)
Benny sat very still on the porch steps, which was unusual for his restless, constant energy. His eyes were wet with unexpected, deep feeling. "I never thought about who we remember," he said quietly, his voice different and deeper than before. "About why it really matters. It is not silly at all. Remembering the people we love is the most important thing."

### Scene 17 (60 words)
Riley had been sketching in her notebook while she listened to every word of the story. Now she looked up with excitement mixed with nervous energy. "What if our market had something like that?" she asked hopefully, clutching her sketchbook. "We could make things that mean something special. Things that share love. Not just to sell. To remember and honor."

### Scene 18 (59 words)
The friends leaned in to encourage her warmly. Riley showed them her sketch with trembling but proud hands. Paper marigolds made from orange tissue paper. Memory cards to write someone's name. A special corner where people could honor someone they love. "You should lead this part, Riley," said Layla with genuine admiration. "You see it so clearly. You should guide us."

### Scene 19 (58 words)
Riley smiled with new confidence blooming inside her chest like one of those marigolds opening. She had shared her creative vision, and people truly liked it! She could lead the memory station at their Community Market. Her creativity mattered to others. Her artistic vision was valued and wanted. For the first time, she felt like a true leader.

### Scene 20 (60 words)
Frances watched them with warm, proud eyes that held generations of wisdom. "Now you understand the heart of it," she said gently. "The market is not just about trading things for money. It is about sharing what matters most to your heart." The friends finally understood value beyond any price — and they would bring that understanding to their own market.
