## MR. MASON'S TRUNK

### Scene 1 (45 words)
The friends walked up the path to Mr. Mason's house one afternoon. He sat on the front porch with a friendly smile. "Perfect timing!" he called out. "I'm finally cleaning my old attic. Would you help me reach some high shelves up there?"

### Scene 2 (46 words)
They followed Mr. Mason inside his cozy house. The living room was filled with interesting things. Photos covered the walls. Maps hung in frames. Little souvenirs sat on every shelf. "You have so many cool things!" Riley said with wonder. "Every one has a story," Mr. Mason replied.

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Mr. Mason led them to a narrow hallway. He pulled down a folding ladder that led up to the attic. Dust floated in the beam of light from above. "I haven't been up here in years," he said. "Let's see what we find together."

### Scene 4 (46 words)
One by one, the friends climbed into the dusty attic. Boxes and old furniture filled every corner. Sunlight streamed through a small window, making the dust sparkle. "Wow," Layla said, looking around in amazement. "It's like a secret museum!" Benny agreed completely with her observation.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
They started helping Mr. Mason organize. He pointed at boxes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away. The friends moved things carefully. It felt like regular cleaning at first. "That can go. That stays," Mr. Mason directed. "Be careful with that one."

### Scene 6 (46 words)
Ellis moved an old blanket in the back corner. Underneath was a large leather trunk covered with colorful stickers from around the world. He could see Paris, Cairo, Tokyo, and Morocco on the labels. "Mr. Mason?" Ellis called with excitement. "What's THIS thing?"

### Scene 7 (46 words)
Everyone gathered around the mysterious trunk. Mr. Mason's face changed when he saw it. Joy and memory mixed together in his expression. He knelt down and touched the old leather gently. "My traveling trunk," he said softly. "This went everywhere with me when I was young."

### Scene 8 (45 words)
Mr. Mason opened the trunk's heavy lid carefully. Inside were objects wrapped in cloth, old photographs, and small treasures from all over the world. "Every object in here is a memory," Mr. Mason explained. "A lesson. A story waiting to be told." The friends leaned closer.

### Scene 9 (46 words)
Mr. Mason lifted out a small leather pouch. He opened it, and the smell of exotic spices filled the attic. He breathed in deeply and smiled. "This is from a market in Morocco," he said. "The spice market... that's where I learned to negotiate."

### Scene 10 (45 words)
Mr. Mason's eyes got distant as he remembered. "Stalls as far as you could see," he began. "Spices in every color. Merchants calling out to everyone." His voice carried them toward that faraway place. The friends listened closely, wanting to hear everything.

### Scene 11 (46 words)
"Go ahead, look inside," Mr. Mason invited. "But carefully — these are more than just things. They're teachers." The friends reached into the trunk with gentle hands. Each one discovered something different among the wrapped treasures. Every item came from a different part of the world.

### Scene 12 (45 words)
Riley lifted out a small carved wooden fish. Mr. Mason nodded when he saw it. "That's from Japan," he explained. "The fish market in Tokyo. I watched an auction that changed how I think about prices." Riley held the fish carefully.

### Scene 13 (46 words)
Benny found a wooden stamp with carved patterns. "What's this?" he asked curiously. "That's a bread stamp from Italy," Mr. Mason said. "From a family bakery that's been running for three generations. They taught me about passing things down." Benny examined it closely.

### Scene 14 (45 words)
Ellis discovered a tiny decorative fishing net. "This came from a Mediterranean fishing village," Mr. Mason explained. "I helped a fisherman sell his catch one morning. I learned that timing matters — some things can't wait." Ellis held the delicate net.

### Scene 15 (46 words)
Layla held up a beautiful hand-carved wooden star ornament. Mr. Mason's face lit up at the sight. "That's from a Christmas market in Germany," he said warmly. "Snow falling, lights glowing, handmade treasures everywhere. Pure magic." Layla admired how it caught the light.

### Scene 16 (45 words)
Mr. Mason sat back and looked at the friends. His face became serious but kind. "These aren't just old things," he said. "They're lessons I've been saving for the right people. I think I've been waiting for you all along."

### Scene 17 (46 words)
The friends were completely captivated. They leaned forward eagerly. "Will you tell us all the stories?" Layla asked. "Please tell us everything!" Benny added. The treasures in the trunk felt like keys to unlock adventures and wisdom from around the whole world.

### Scene 18 (45 words)
Mr. Mason smiled at their excitement. "One story at a time," he agreed. "Each object has a lesson. Let's start with the spices." He held up the pouch again. "The markets of Morocco... that's where our journey begins. Ready?"

### Scene 19 (46 words)
As Mr. Mason described the Moroccan market, something magical seemed to happen. The edges of the attic appeared to soften. Colors and sounds from a distant place seemed to shimmer around them. The memory was beginning to come alive in front of their eyes.

### Scene 20 (46 words)
The friends settled around the trunk, ready to travel through Mr. Mason's memories. They were about to learn from markets all over the world. And in Layla's mind, their Community Market idea grew stronger. Learning from the best markets would help them build their own.
