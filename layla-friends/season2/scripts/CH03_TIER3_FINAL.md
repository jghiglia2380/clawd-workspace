## THE BUSY SATURDAY

### Scene 1 (50 words)
The four friends met outside the community center on Saturday morning. They weren't sure what to do with their day yet. Before they could decide, several neighbors started walking toward them from different directions. It looked like everyone had something they needed help with today.

### Scene 2 (51 words)
Mrs. Patterson arrived first. "My garage is a disaster," she explained. "I need help organizing it." Frances approached next. "My garden needs weeding badly." Then Mr. Johnson appeared with a stack of papers. "Could someone deliver these flyers around the neighborhood?" The friends looked at each other, overwhelmed.

### Scene 3 (50 words)
"We want to help everyone," Layla said to her friends. "Let's start with the garage." They walked to Mrs. Patterson's house together. "If we all work on it together, we'll finish fast," Layla said confidently. The four friends crowded into the cluttered garage, ready to work as a team.

### Scene 4 (51 words)
Inside the garage, chaos erupted immediately. Benny picked up a box, but Ellis was already sorting items from it. Riley and Layla both reached for the same lamp at once. Everyone bumped into each other constantly. "Wait, I was organizing those!" Ellis said with frustration. "Oops, sorry!" Benny replied.

### Scene 5 (50 words)
Thirty minutes passed slowly. Mrs. Patterson peeked inside to check their progress. The garage looked almost exactly the same as before. The friends stood there, sweaty and frustrated. "How's it going?" Mrs. Patterson asked gently. Layla sighed. "We're trying, but it's hard when everyone's doing everything at once."

### Scene 6 (51 words)
Ellis stepped back to observe the situation. "I think the problem is that we keep getting in each other's way," he said thoughtfully. "What if each person focused on just ONE job instead of all of us doing everything?" The others stopped to consider his suggestion. It made sense.

### Scene 7 (50 words)
They divided the tasks based on each person's strengths. Benny would carry the heavy boxes since he was the strongest. Ellis would sort and label items because he was organized. Riley would arrange things attractively using her creativity. Layla would direct everyone and make final decisions as the leader.

### Scene 8 (51 words)
With everyone in their assigned roles, work began again. This time felt completely different. Benny moved boxes without anyone getting in his way. Ellis sorted items into neat categories without interruption. Riley made the shelves look beautiful. Layla kept everything flowing smoothly. No more bumping. No more confusion.

### Scene 9 (50 words)
The garage transformed before their eyes. Boxes stood in neat stacks along the walls. Tools hung in organized rows on pegboards. Clear pathways allowed easy movement through the space. The friends stepped back to admire their work. "Wow!" Riley exclaimed. "We actually did it!" Everyone smiled with pride.

### Scene 10 (51 words)
Mrs. Patterson returned and gasped with amazement at the change. "This is incredible!" she said. "You discovered something very important today. When everyone focuses on what they're best at, the whole team succeeds. There's actually a name for this — it's called division of labor." The friends remembered that term.

### Scene 11 (50 words)
Energized by their success, the friends headed to Frances's garden. This time they planned their roles while walking. "Let's decide jobs BEFORE we start," Layla suggested. Everyone agreed immediately. Benny would handle strength tasks. Ellis would organize. Riley would add beauty. Layla would coordinate. They had a system now.

### Scene 12 (51 words)
In Frances's garden, everyone moved to their stations efficiently. Benny yanked out the large stubborn weeds. Riley planted flowers in beautiful patterns that pleased the eye. Ellis tracked what was done and what remained. Layla floated between tasks, helping wherever needed. Frances watched with surprise. "My, you're very organized!"

### Scene 13 (50 words)
What could have taken all day finished in just one hour. The garden rows stood neat and colorful. New flowers bloomed where weeds once grew. The friends high-fived each other with satisfaction. "Done already?" Benny laughed. "That would have taken forever if we'd all been doing the same thing!"

### Scene 14 (51 words)
Next came the flyer delivery. Ellis studied the neighborhood map and planned the most efficient route. He divided the streets into sections. Layla and Riley each took nearby areas. Benny ran to the farther houses since he had the most energy. Everyone moved with purpose and confidence toward their destinations.

### Scene 15 (50 words)
The friends reconvened at their starting point after finishing their routes. Every flyer had been delivered successfully. Empty bags hung from their arms. The sun was still high in the sky. "All done!" Layla announced happily. "And it's not even noon yet!" Three big jobs completed before lunch.

### Scene 16 (51 words)
They rested on a front porch, sharing snacks and drinks from their backpacks. The morning had been incredibly productive. "That felt so different once we divided up the work," Riley commented between bites. Ellis nodded. "Having my own job meant I could focus without getting confused by everyone else."

### Scene 17 (50 words)
The friends talked about their different strengths. Benny was strong and energetic. Ellis was organized and logical. Riley was creative and artistic. Layla was a natural leader who kept everyone moving. "We're a good team BECAUSE we're different," Benny realized. Their differences made them more effective together, not less.

### Scene 18 (51 words)
Layla remembered their conversations about the swap meet. "If we ever do our own market," she said thoughtfully, "we shouldn't all bring the same things there either." The lemonade lesson combined with today's experience. Different strengths meant different contributions. That was how successful teams worked in the real world.

### Scene 19 (50 words)
The friends started imagining possibilities for their Community Market idea. "I could make crafts to sell," Riley suggested with excitement. "I could keep track of everything," Ellis offered. "I could help carry and set up," Benny added. "And I could organize the whole thing," Layla said. Everyone had a role.

### Scene 20 (52 words)
Layla leaned in toward her friends with growing excitement. "We work so well together now," she said. "What if we actually DID something big? Like a real Community Market for the whole neighborhood?" The idea felt real and possible now. But first, they needed to learn more about how markets worked.
