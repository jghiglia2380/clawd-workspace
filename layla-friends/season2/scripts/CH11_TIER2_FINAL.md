## EL MERCADO DE LOS MUERTOS

### Scene 1 (45 words)
The friends visited Frances on her comfortable front porch. The afternoon sun was warm and golden, casting long shadows. "We have learned so much about markets," said Layla thoughtfully. "Value, timing, teamwork. But something still feels missing from our plans." They looked at Frances hopefully.

### Scene 2 (46 words)
Frances nodded with deep understanding. "You have learned how markets work," she said gently. "Now you need to learn why they truly matter. The heart of a market." She settled back in her old rocking chair with a knowing smile. "Let me tell you a very special story."

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Frances's eyes got soft and far away, seeing another time. "When I was nine years old, my abuelita took me to Mexico," she began slowly. "We went to a very special market. Close your eyes. Try to smell the flowers. Hear the prayers."

### Scene 4 (46 words)
The porch faded away around them. Bright, vivid colors appeared everywhere they looked. Orange and purple and gold! They stood in a Mexican town square. Flowers filled every corner and doorway. This was the market before Día de los Muertos — the Day of the Dead celebration.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
Young Frances held her grandmother's hand tightly. Her eyes were wide with wonder at everything around her. "Abuelita, why is everything so orange?" she asked with curiosity. "That color guides them home, mija," said her grandmother softly, squeezing her hand. "The spirits follow the brightness."

### Scene 6 (46 words)
They walked to a flower stall overflowing with blooms. Mountains of orange marigolds called cempasúchil filled the air with their sweet, strong smell. The vendor smiled warmly at Abuelita like an old friend. "Doña Elena! Your flowers are waiting!" They knew each other from many years.

### Scene 7 (45 words)
Young Frances asked why they needed so many bright flowers. Abuelita explained gently, kneeling to look into her eyes. "The bright color and sweet smell guide the spirits home to us. These are not just pretty decorations. They are a path of love and memory."

### Scene 8 (46 words)
They visited a woman carefully making sugar skulls called calaveras. She decorated each one with a name written in colorful icing. "Tell me their names," she said kindly. "I write them here so they know we remember and love them." Abuelita said three precious names softly.

### Scene 9 (45 words)
Young Frances suddenly understood. These were not candy treats to eat. They were tributes to honor the dead. Each decorated skull represented someone who had passed away. Someone's grandmother. Someone's child. Someone deeply loved and missed. She touched one very gently with respect and wonder.

### Scene 10 (46 words)
They bought tall candles for the ofrenda they would build at home. "Each flame is a prayer," the vendor explained with reverence. "Your prayer is the light that guides them through the dark night." Young Frances listened carefully, understanding that even a small flame held great meaning.

### Scene 11 (45 words)
They bought pan de muerto from the warm bakery. This special bread was shaped like bones on top. The kind baker gave young Frances a small taste. It was sweet and wonderful. "We bake with our hands what we carry in our hearts," she said.

### Scene 12 (46 words)
As they walked through the crowded market, Abuelita shared something important. "Everything here was made by hand with love and intention," she explained. "That is what gives these things their special power. The hands that made them put their hearts inside every piece and every petal."

### Scene 13 (45 words)
Young Frances helped pick papel picado — colorful cut paper banners. She also chose fabric for their home ofrenda. She picked purple and gold carefully. "These were Abuelo's favorite colors," she said proudly. "I want him to see them and know we remember him always."

### Scene 14 (46 words)
Later that evening, the whole family built their ofrenda together. They placed flowers, candles, photos, decorated skulls, and bread with care. Everyone helped, from the oldest to the youngest. They were not creating this for money or for praise. They were creating it purely for love.

### Scene 15 (45 words)
The memory faded softly like candlelight dimming. Frances was back on her porch, and the friends sat around her quietly. Some things are not made to be sold for any price. They are made to mean something very important. To remember. To honor. To love.

### Scene 16 (46 words)
Benny sat very still, which was unusual for him. His eyes were wet with feeling. "I never thought about who we remember," he said quietly, his voice different. "About why it matters. It is not silly at all. Remembering the people we love is the most important thing."

### Scene 17 (45 words)
Riley had been sketching in her notebook while she listened to the story. Now she looked up with excitement mixed with nervousness. "What if our market had something like that?" she asked hopefully. "We could make things that mean something special. Things that share love."

### Scene 18 (46 words)
The friends leaned in to encourage her warmly. Riley showed them her sketch with trembling hands. Paper marigolds made from orange tissue paper. Memory cards to write someone's name. A special corner where people could honor someone they love. "You should lead this part," said Layla with admiration. "You see it."

### Scene 19 (45 words)
Riley smiled with new confidence blooming inside her. She had shared her creative idea, and people truly liked it! She could lead the memory station at their Community Market. Her creativity mattered to others. Her artistic vision was valued and wanted. She had found her place.

### Scene 20 (46 words)
Frances watched them with warm, proud eyes. "Now you understand the heart of it," she said gently. "The market is not just about trading things for money. It is about sharing what matters most to your heart." The friends finally understood the difference between price and value.
