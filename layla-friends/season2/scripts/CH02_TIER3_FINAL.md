## THE LEMONADE PROBLEM

### Scene 1 (50 words)
Layla sat by her window on a scorching summer day. The sun blazed outside, making everything shimmer with heat. She fanned herself with a magazine. "Everyone must be so thirsty today," she thought. Then an idea struck her. A lemonade stand would be perfect on a day like this!

### Scene 2 (51 words)
Layla hurried to the kitchen with excitement. She found lemons in the refrigerator and squeezed them into a large pitcher. She added sugar and cold water, stirring until everything mixed together. The lemonade looked perfectly yellow and refreshing. "This is going to sell out fast," she said confidently to herself.

### Scene 3 (50 words)
Layla carried a small folding table to her front yard. She set up cups in neat rows and placed her pitcher in the center. Then she made a colorful sign: "LEMONADE 50¢" with drawings of lemon slices around the edges. Everything looked ready. Now she just needed customers.

### Scene 4 (51 words)
Layla looked up from her stand and froze with surprise. A few houses down the street, she spotted another lemonade stand. Someone was setting up cups and a pitcher just like hers. She squinted to see better. "Wait — is that Riley?" she said aloud. Riley had the same idea!

### Scene 5 (50 words)
Layla walked down the sidewalk to investigate further. Her eyes grew wider with each step. Riley's stand was just the beginning. Ellis had a stand. Benny had a stand. Two other neighborhood kids had stands too. She counted them all in disbelief. Six lemonade stands on one street!

### Scene 6 (51 words)
Layla returned to her stand and waited for customers. An hour passed slowly. A few people walked by on the sidewalk, but nobody stopped to buy. They seemed to have too many choices. Layla rested her chin in her hands and stared at her full pitcher. Something wasn't working.

### Scene 7 (50 words)
Layla walked over to Riley's stand to compare notes. Riley looked just as confused and frustrated. "Have you sold any lemonade?" Layla asked hopefully. Riley shook her head sadly. "Not a single cup. I don't understand — it's so hot outside!" They both looked at the quiet street.

### Scene 8 (51 words)
Ellis and Benny joined them in the middle of the street. Everyone had the same disappointing story. Plenty of lemonade, zero customers. "I was sure everyone would be thirsty today," Benny said with frustration. Ellis looked up and down the street at all the stands, his mind starting to work.

### Scene 9 (50 words)
Ellis studied the situation carefully. He counted the stands again and then counted the people walking by. "Let me think about this," he said slowly. "Six stands. Maybe twenty people walking past in an hour. That means only three or four possible customers for each stand." The math wasn't good.

### Scene 10 (51 words)
"I think I understand the problem," Ellis announced. His friends turned to listen. "There's too much lemonade and not enough people who want it. We're all trying to sell to the same small group of customers." Layla nodded as the explanation made sense. They were competing against each other.

### Scene 11 (50 words)
Layla noticed one of the other neighborhood kids changing their sign. The price dropped from fifty cents to twenty-five cents. "Look at that," she pointed out. "They're lowering their price to get more customers." The strategy seemed clever at first. Would it work to attract more buyers?

### Scene 12 (51 words)
Soon other stands followed the same approach. Prices dropped everywhere. Twenty-five cents became twenty cents. Twenty cents became fifteen cents. Kids frantically changed their signs, each trying to be the cheapest option. But even with lower prices, people still weren't buying much. The street was in a pricing war.

### Scene 13 (50 words)
The friends gathered together feeling discouraged. "This is terrible," Benny groaned. "Now we're practically giving lemonade away, and still nobody's buying!" Riley crossed her arms in frustration. "There has to be a smarter solution than just making everything cheaper and cheaper." They needed to think differently about this problem.

### Scene 14 (51 words)
Layla's face brightened as a new idea formed. "What if we stopped competing against each other?" she suggested. "Instead of six small stands fighting for customers, we could create ONE amazing stand together." Her friends considered the possibility. Working together instead of against each other might change everything completely.

### Scene 15 (50 words)
The four friends carried their supplies to Layla's front yard. They combined their lemons, their pitchers, their cups. Together they had more than enough for a serious lemonade operation. "We can make way more lemonade together," Ellis observed. "And it only takes one stand to attract attention."

### Scene 16 (51 words)
Each friend contributed their special skills to the new stand. Riley painted a beautiful new sign with bright colors and fancy letters. Ellis organized the supplies for quick, efficient serving. Benny arranged the cups in an impressive display. Layla sliced fresh lemons to float in the pitchers for decoration.

### Scene 17 (50 words)
Their combined stand looked amazing. The colorful sign caught everyone's attention from far away. The neat setup looked professional and trustworthy. People walking by actually stopped to look. "Fresh lemonade!" the friends called out together. "Made by friends, for friends!" The energy felt completely different from before.

### Scene 18 (51 words)
Customers finally started lining up. Without so much competition cluttering the street, their single impressive stand became the obvious choice. The friends worked as a team — pouring, collecting money, and thanking each customer. "This is so much better than six tiny stands!" a customer commented cheerfully. Business was good.

### Scene 19 (50 words)
As the sun began setting, the friends counted their earnings together. They had made more money working together than they ever would have separately. Ellis smiled at the lesson. "When there's too much of something, prices drop and nobody wins. But working together made us special and valuable."

### Scene 20 (52 words)
Layla connected the day's lesson to their bigger plans. "For our Community Market, we shouldn't all bring the same things," she realized. "If everyone sells lemonade, nobody does well. But if everyone brings something different, there's no competition — just variety." The friends nodded in agreement. Variety was the answer.
