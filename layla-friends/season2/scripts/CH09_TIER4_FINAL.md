## LA VECINA'S GARDEN

### Scene 1 (58 words)
The friends walked together down a sunny, tree-lined street toward Frances's welcoming house. They had heard many wonderful stories from Mr. Mason lately, and those stories had sparked their imaginations. "Frances might have her own stories to share too," said Layla thoughtfully, considering the possibility. "She has lived in this neighborhood for a very long time. Let's ask her about markets!"

### Scene 2 (60 words)
They found Frances working in her beautiful, flourishing garden. She had rich brown dirt on her capable hands and a warm, welcoming smile on her face. Tomatoes, peppers, and fragrant herbs grew all around her in carefully tended rows. She looked up when she heard their familiar footsteps approaching on the path. "Hello, mijos! Come help me dig in the dirt!"

### Scene 3 (59 words)
Frances led them to a special garden bed near the wooden fence. She showed them the seeds they had planted together back in Season 1, during their first adventure with the seed library. Those tiny seeds were now healthy, thriving plants! "Remember when these were so small?" she asked gently, touching a leaf. "You waited patiently. Now look at them!"

### Scene 4 (58 words)
The friends excitedly told Frances all about their Community Market plans. They shared the wonderful stories Mr. Mason had been telling them from his mysterious trunk in the attic. "Do you have stories about markets and buying and selling too?" they asked hopefully, their eyes bright with anticipation. They had a strong feeling Frances knew many special things.

### Scene 5 (60 words)
Frances got a faraway look in her warm brown eyes, as if she were seeing something from long ago. It was exactly the same look Mr. Mason would get when a precious memory was returning to him. "I do have a story," she said softly with a gentle, knowing smile. "Let me tell you about a very special woman named Doña Carmen."

### Scene 6 (59 words)
The beautiful garden seemed to shimmer and change around them like a dream beginning. Colors shifted to warmer, older tones like a faded photograph from another era. Now they saw a neighborhood from long ago. The houses looked different with their older architecture. The cars looked old-fashioned. This was Frances's childhood, from many years before the friends were even born.

### Scene 7 (58 words)
A little girl walked down the sunny sidewalk, her footsteps light and quick. It was young Frances when she was about eight years old! She had some coins jingling cheerfully in her pocket. Her mama had sent her on an important errand to buy fresh tomatoes for dinner. She knew exactly where to go for the best ones.

### Scene 8 (60 words)
Young Frances arrived at a house with a small wooden table set up in the front yard. Beautiful red tomatoes, colorful peppers in yellows and greens, and fresh fragrant herbs were laid out simply on the table. An elderly woman with silver hair pulled back in a bun stood there arranging things with gentle care. Her name was Doña Carmen.

### Scene 9 (59 words)
"Hola, Francesita!" said Doña Carmen with a warm, welcoming smile that crinkled the corners of her kind eyes. She knew every person in the whole neighborhood by name and by story. "How is your mama feeling? How is school going?" She truly cared about the little girl standing before her. They weren't just customer and seller — they were neighbors.

### Scene 10 (58 words)
Doña Carmen gently helped young Frances pick the very best tomatoes from the colorful display. "Feel this one," she said kindly, guiding the girl's small hand over the smooth, sun-warmed skin. "See how it gives just a little when you press? That means it's perfectly ripe and ready to eat. This other one needs another day in the sun."

### Scene 11 (60 words)
Young Frances counted out her coins carefully and paid for the tomatoes, feeling grown-up and responsible. But then Doña Carmen added a generous handful of extra peppers to the paper bag! "These are for your mama," she said warmly. "You don't need to pay for these, mija. We're neighbors. This is how community works — we take care of each other."

### Scene 12 (59 words)
Young Frances walked home happily, swinging her bag, feeling the weight of her successful errand. She could see Doña Carmen's abundant garden right from the street. She knew exactly which patch of dark, rich earth those tomatoes had grown in. She knew who had planted the seeds, watered them carefully every morning, and picked them with her own loving hands.

### Scene 13 (58 words)
This felt so different from buying things at a big store where nobody knew your name. At the store, you don't know any of the workers. But at Doña Carmen's little stand, you felt like family. Frances's mama trusted Doña Carmen completely. That trust between neighbors was worth more than any price could possibly measure or money could buy.

### Scene 14 (60 words)
The old neighborhood slowly faded away around them, colors shifting like watercolors in rain. The warm tones returned to the present day. Frances sat peacefully in her garden, and the friends sat around her listening carefully. The memory was finished, but the important lesson about community and trust would stay with them forever, planted deep in their hearts like seeds.

### Scene 15 (59 words)
"Doña Carmen taught me so much about growing food and sharing generously with others," said Frances with emotion in her voice. "I've tried to do the same thing with my seed library, passing on what I learned. Now I'm teaching you. Someday you'll teach someone else. That's how knowledge keeps living through generations — passed from hand to hand."

### Scene 16 (58 words)
"What made Doña Carmen's stand so special?" asked Ellis, genuinely curious about the important details. Frances smiled with understanding. "You knew her personally. You trusted her completely. She cared about what she sold because she cared about the people buying it — about YOU. That personal connection between people makes all the difference in the world."

### Scene 17 (60 words)
The friends thought carefully about how this lesson applied to their Community Market plans. "Our market should feel exactly like this," said Layla with growing excitement and understanding. "Like a real neighborhood. Like neighbors helping neighbors who actually know each other and genuinely care about each other's wellbeing." She was beginning to see what made a market truly special and meaningful.

### Scene 18 (59 words)
Frances had a thoughtful question for them to consider carefully. "What would YOU sell at your own little stand?" she asked with warm encouragement. "What would you grow, make, or share with others? And how would you treat your neighbors when they came to buy from you? Think about it. The answer matters more than the product itself."

### Scene 19 (58 words)
The friends got excited imagining all their possibilities at the market. "I would definitely offer my art!" said Riley eagerly. "I could help organize and keep track of everything!" said Ellis. "I'm really good at carrying heavy things!" said Benny. But Layla wasn't sure yet what her special thing would be. Her role was still waiting to be discovered.

### Scene 20 (60 words)
"I have more stories to share with you," Frances promised with a gentle, knowing smile. "A German Christmas market I once visited. A tradition from my family in Mexico. But one story at a time, mijos. Like good tomatoes ripening slowly in the sun." The friends couldn't wait to hear more! Each story brought them closer to their own market.
