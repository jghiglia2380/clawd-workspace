## LA VECINA'S GARDEN

### Scene 1 (50 words)
The friends walked together down a sunny street toward Frances's house. They had heard many wonderful stories from Mr. Mason lately. "Frances might have stories to share too," said Layla thoughtfully. "She has lived in this neighborhood for a very long time. Let's ask her about markets!"

### Scene 2 (51 words)
They found Frances working in her beautiful garden. She had rich brown dirt on her hands and a warm smile on her face. Tomatoes, peppers, and fragrant herbs grew all around her in carefully tended rows. She looked up when she heard their footsteps. "Hello! Come help me dig in the dirt!"

### Scene 3 (50 words)
Frances led them to a special garden bed near the fence. She showed them the seeds they had planted together back in Season 1. Those tiny seeds were now healthy, growing plants! "Remember when these were so small?" she asked gently. "You waited patiently. Now look at them!"

### Scene 4 (51 words)
The friends excitedly told Frances about their Community Market plans. They shared all the wonderful stories Mr. Mason had been telling them from his trunk. "Do you have stories about markets and buying and selling too?" they asked hopefully. They had a strong feeling Frances knew many special things.

### Scene 5 (50 words)
Frances got a faraway look in her warm brown eyes. It was exactly the same look Mr. Mason would get when a precious memory was returning. "I do have a story," she said softly with a gentle smile. "Let me tell you about a very special woman named Doña Carmen."

### Scene 6 (51 words)
The beautiful garden seemed to shimmer and change around them. Colors shifted to warmer, older tones like a faded photograph. Now they saw a neighborhood from long ago. The houses looked different. The cars looked old-fashioned. This was Frances's childhood, from many years before the friends were even born.

### Scene 7 (50 words)
A little girl walked down the sunny sidewalk. It was young Frances when she was about eight years old! She had some coins jingling in her pocket. Her mama had sent her on an important errand to buy fresh tomatoes. She knew exactly where to go for them.

### Scene 8 (51 words)
Young Frances arrived at a house with a small wooden table in the front yard. Beautiful red tomatoes, colorful peppers, and fresh green herbs were laid out simply on the table. An elderly woman with silver hair stood there arranging things with care. Her name was Doña Carmen.

### Scene 9 (50 words)
"Hola, Francesita!" said Doña Carmen with a warm, welcoming smile. She knew every person in the whole neighborhood by name. "How is your mama feeling? How is school going?" She truly cared about the little girl standing before her. They weren't just customer and seller — they were neighbors.

### Scene 10 (51 words)
Doña Carmen gently helped young Frances pick the very best tomatoes from the display. "Feel this one," she said kindly, guiding the girl's small hand over the smooth skin. "See how it gives just a little when you press? That means it's perfectly ripe. This other one needs another day."

### Scene 11 (50 words)
Young Frances counted out her coins carefully and paid for the tomatoes. But then Doña Carmen added a generous handful of extra peppers to the bag! "These are for your mama," she said warmly. "You don't need to pay for these. We're neighbors. This is how community works."

### Scene 12 (51 words)
Young Frances walked home happily, swinging her bag. She could see Doña Carmen's garden right from the street. She knew exactly which patch of dark earth those tomatoes had grown in. She knew who had planted the seeds, watered them carefully, and picked them with her own loving hands.

### Scene 13 (50 words)
This felt so different from buying things at a big store. At the store, you don't know any of the workers. But at Doña Carmen's little stand, you felt like family. Frances's mama trusted Doña Carmen completely. That trust between neighbors was worth more than any price could measure.

### Scene 14 (51 words)
The old neighborhood slowly faded away around them. Colors shifted back to the present day. Frances sat peacefully in her garden, and the friends sat around her listening carefully. The memory was finished, but the important lesson about community and trust would stay with them forever in their hearts.

### Scene 15 (50 words)
"Doña Carmen taught me so much about growing food and sharing with others," said Frances with emotion in her voice. "I've tried to do the same with my seed library. Now I'm teaching you. Someday you'll teach someone else. That's how knowledge keeps living through generations."

### Scene 16 (51 words)
"What made Doña Carmen's stand so special?" asked Ellis, curious about the details. Frances smiled with understanding. "You knew her personally. You trusted her completely. She cared about what she sold because she cared about the people buying it — about YOU. That connection between people makes all the difference."

### Scene 17 (50 words)
The friends thought about how this lesson applied to their Community Market plans. "Our market should feel exactly like this," said Layla with growing excitement and understanding. "Like a real neighborhood. Like neighbors helping neighbors who actually know each other and genuinely care about each other's wellbeing."

### Scene 18 (51 words)
Frances had a thoughtful question for them to consider. "What would YOU sell at your own little stand?" she asked with encouragement. "What would you grow, make, or share with others? And how would you treat your neighbors when they came to buy from you? Think about it."

### Scene 19 (50 words)
The friends got excited imagining their possibilities at the market. "I would definitely offer my art!" said Riley eagerly. "I could help organize and keep track of everything!" said Ellis. "I'm really good at carrying heavy things!" said Benny. But Layla wasn't sure yet what her special thing would be.

### Scene 20 (51 words)
"I have more stories to share with you," Frances promised with a gentle smile. "A German Christmas market I once visited. A tradition from my family in Mexico. But one story at a time, mijos. Like good tomatoes ripening slowly in the sun." The friends couldn't wait to hear more!
