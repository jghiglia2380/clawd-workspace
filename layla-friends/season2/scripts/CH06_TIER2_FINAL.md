## THE FISH AUCTION

### Scene 1 (45 words)
Mr. Mason reached into the trunk again. This time he pulled out a small carved wooden fish. It was smooth and beautiful. "This comes from Japan," he said, holding it carefully. "In Morocco, I learned to negotiate. In Japan, I learned about auctions. Have you heard of auctions?"

### Scene 2 (46 words)
The attic slowly faded away. They found themselves in a huge building. It was a giant fish market in Japan. The sky outside was still dark because it was very early morning. Bright lights shone everywhere inside. Workers were already busy. The market never seemed to sleep.

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Young Mr. Mason walked through the enormous market with wide eyes. Giant tuna lay in long rows on the cold floor. Some fish were bigger than a person! Workers inspected each fish carefully with flashlights. The air smelled like the ocean. It was an amazing sight.

### Scene 4 (46 words)
He found his way to the auction area. Many buyers had gathered there. They wore special numbered hats and carried notebooks. The giant tuna were lined up with tags. A bell suddenly rang across the hall. Everyone grew quiet. Something important was about to begin right now.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
An auctioneer stepped up to the front. He began speaking rapidly in Japanese. Young Mr. Mason could not understand a single word. But he watched the buyers carefully. Their eyes were sharp. Their bodies were tense. They were focused completely on the fish and the auctioneer.

### Scene 6 (46 words)
Suddenly hands shot up everywhere. Fingers flashed numbers. The buyers were bidding on the fish! They were competing against each other. Each one wanted to win. Young Mr. Mason realized this was like a race, but instead of running, they were offering more and more money.

### Scene 7 (45 words)
Two buyers really wanted the same beautiful tuna. They kept raising their bids higher and higher. Back and forth they went. The price climbed quickly. Young Mr. Mason watched with his mouth open. He could not believe how expensive one single fish could become through competition.

### Scene 8 (46 words)
Finally, one buyer gave up and stopped bidding. The other buyer had won! A bell rang loudly. The winner bowed respectfully to the auctioneer. Workers marked the giant tuna with the winner's number. People around them clapped politely. The auction for that fish was complete and final.

### Scene 9 (45 words)
Young Mr. Mason found a friendly buyer at the edge of the auction area. "Who decides the price?" the young man asked curiously. The buyer laughed warmly. "We do! The buyers decide the price, not the seller. The seller just watches and waits for us."

### Scene 10 (46 words)
The buyer explained more to help him understand. "In an auction, buyers compete against each other, not the seller. We fight with prices. Whoever wants something the most will pay the most for it." Young Mr. Mason nodded slowly. This was very different from negotiating in Morocco.

### Scene 11 (45 words)
Young Mr. Mason walked through the market with new understanding. He saw it happening everywhere now. When many buyers wanted the same fish, the price went up. When fewer people were interested, the price stayed lower. Competition between buyers was what pushed prices higher and higher.

### Scene 12 (46 words)
At a small stall near the exit, young Mr. Mason found carved wooden souvenirs. He bought a little wooden fish to remember this important day. Every time he looked at it, he would remember what he learned about auctions and how competition affects prices in the market.

### Scene 13 (45 words)
The busy fish market began to fade away. Colors softened and swirled. Slowly, they found themselves back in the familiar warm attic. Mr. Mason was old again, but he still held the same wooden fish in his wrinkled hands. The memories lived on in that object.

### Scene 14 (46 words)
The friends looked at Mr. Mason with amazement. "So when lots of people want the same thing, the price goes up?" asked Benny, checking his understanding. "Exactly right!" Mr. Mason replied with a proud smile. He carefully placed the carved fish back into his special trunk.

### Scene 15 (47 words)
Ellis suddenly spoke up with excitement in his voice. "Wait! That's the opposite of what happened with our lemonade!" Everyone turned to look at him. "We had too many sellers competing. At the auction, there are too many buyers competing. That makes the prices go in different directions!"

### Scene 16 (45 words)
The other friends stared at Ellis with new respect. "That's a really smart observation," said Layla, nodding thoughtfully. "You're really good at figuring out how things connect," added Riley. Ellis smiled and sat up straighter. His careful thinking had helped everyone understand the lesson better.

### Scene 17 (46 words)
"Could we have an auction at our Community Market?" asked Riley, her eyes bright with the idea. The friends got excited quickly. "People could bid on something really special!" said Benny. "They could use play coins!" This could be a fun addition to their market.

### Scene 18 (45 words)
Ellis reached into his pocket and pulled out a small notebook. He began writing down their ideas carefully. "An auction," he said while writing. "And fair prices." He liked keeping track of everything. The group needed someone organized, and Ellis was happy to do it.

### Scene 19 (46 words)
Mr. Mason smiled warmly at their enthusiasm and planning. "There are more objects in this trunk," he reminded them. "More stories from markets around the world. Italy with its fishing boats. Germany with its winter festival. Each place teaches something new about buying and selling."

### Scene 20 (47 words)
The friends leaned forward eagerly. Each story was teaching them something valuable. They would use all these lessons when they created their own Community Market. "Keep going, Mr. Mason!" said Layla excitedly. "We want to learn everything we can!" The old man chuckled and reached for the trunk.
