## LA TAMALADA & THE COMMUNITY MARKET

### Scene 1 (30 words)
It was the morning of the big day. The friends went to Frances's kitchen early. The counter was covered with things to make tamales. Frances smiled at them warmly.

### Scene 2 (31 words)
"Before your market opens, I want to teach you something," said Frances. "My grandmother taught me this. A tamalada is not just making food. It is a family working together as one."

### Scene 3 (30 words)
Frances got a faraway look. She remembered her own childhood tamalada. Many hands working. Laughter filling the kitchen. Her abuela guiding everyone. Then she looked at the friends. "Today, you are my family."

### Scene 4 (31 words)
Frances gave each friend a job. Riley would spread the masa dough. Ellis would add the filling. Benny would wrap them up tight. Layla would check that each one looked right. Assembly line!

### Scene 5 (30 words)
At first, it was hard. Riley's masa was bumpy. Benny wrapped too loose. Ellis put in too much filling. But Frances did not get upset. "Wrong is how you learn. Try again."

### Scene 6 (31 words)
They kept trying. Soon they found their rhythm. Riley's masa got smooth. Ellis used just the right amount. Benny's wraps got tight and neat. Layla caught problems early. They were working together beautifully!

### Scene 7 (30 words)
Frances stopped them to look. "See? None of you could make these alone," she said proudly. "But together, look what you made!" Dozens of perfect tamales were ready. They had done it.

### Scene 8 (31 words)
The tamales went into a big pot to steam. While they waited, Frances said, "This is what collaboration means. Each person matters. Each job is important. Together you make something wonderful. Remember this always."

### Scene 9 (30 words)
The friends talked about their market plan. They had a swap area. An auction corner. Riley's craft station. A memory corner to honor people. Frances added helpful ideas. They were ready!

### Scene 10 (31 words)
Frances opened the pot. Steam rose up. The tamales were perfect! "These carry more than food," she said. "They carry everything you learned this season. Share them wisely today. Now go make your market beautiful."

### Scene 11 (30 words)
At the park, they set up their Community Market. Neighbors came to help carry tables. Everyone brought something to share. Layla smiled. "This is really happening!" Mrs. Patterson waved. "Wouldn't miss it!"

### Scene 12 (31 words)
The market had different areas. A place to swap things. A corner for auctions. Riley's craft station with paper marigolds. A special memory corner. The tamales stayed warm. Everything they learned was here!

### Scene 13 (30 words)
Two neighbors could not agree on a trade. Layla stepped in calmly. She listened to both of them. She helped them see each other's side. They made a fair trade. Layla had learned patience.

### Scene 14 (31 words)
Ellis ran the auction corner. He explained the rules clearly. He kept track of all the bids. He made sure everything was fair. His careful thinking made it all work. He felt proud.

### Scene 15 (30 words)
Riley led the memory station. Families made paper flowers and cards. "Can I make one for my grandpa?" asked a child. "Of course," said Riley with a smile. "I will show you how."

### Scene 16 (31 words)
A shy little kid stood near the memory corner. Benny saw him. He walked over quietly and knelt down. "It's okay to miss people," Benny said gently. "Making something for them helps. Sit with me."

### Scene 17 (30 words)
Frances and the friends shared the tamales. Not sold — shared freely. Neighbors tasted and smiled. "These are wonderful!" someone said. "How did you make them?" Frances smiled. "We made them together. As a family."

### Scene 18 (31 words)
Mr. Mason arrived, leaning on his cane. He looked at everything. The auction. The crafts. The memory corner. His eyes got wet. "You listened. You learned. You made it your own. I am so proud."

### Scene 19 (30 words)
A young kid came up to the friends. "That was so cool!" he said. "Can you teach me how to do this next year?" The friends looked at each other and smiled.

### Scene 20 (31 words)
The sun was setting golden. People went home happy with treasures and memories. Layla said, "We did not just have a market. We shared everything we learned." They were no longer just learners. They were teachers.
