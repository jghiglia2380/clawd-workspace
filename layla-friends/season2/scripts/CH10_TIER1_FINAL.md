## THE CHRISTMAS MARKET

### Scene 1 (30 words)
Mr. Mason reached deep into his trunk. He pulled out a beautiful wooden star. It had tiny carvings all over it. "This one is very special," he said softly.

### Scene 2 (31 words)
The attic began to change. Snow appeared. Tiny lights twinkled everywhere. Now they saw a magical winter market. Little wooden houses stood in rows. This was a German Christmas market!

### Scene 3 (30 words)
Young Mr. Mason walked through the market. Small shops sold wooden toys and ornaments. Steam rose from cups of warm cocoa. The air smelled like cinnamon and pine trees.

### Scene 4 (31 words)
Each little shop sold one special thing. One shop had only nutcrackers. One had only candles. One had only glass balls. Each seller was very good at making one thing.

### Scene 5 (30 words)
Young Mr. Mason stopped at a wooden toy shop. An old man sat at a tiny table. He was carving a piece of wood. His hands moved very carefully.

### Scene 6 (31 words)
The man's name was Klaus. He did not look up. He kept carving. A simple block of wood became a beautiful star right before their eyes. It was like magic!

### Scene 7 (30 words)
Klaus finally looked up at young Mr. Mason. "My grandfather made stars," Klaus said. "My father made stars. I make stars. My son will make stars too."

### Scene 8 (31 words)
"Why only stars?" asked young Mr. Mason. Klaus smiled a warm smile. "Do one thing really well," he said. "That is how people remember you. Do one thing with your heart."

### Scene 9 (30 words)
Klaus explained something important. A machine can make many stars. But they all look the same. Klaus made each star by hand. Each one was a little bit different.

### Scene 10 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason understood. When you buy something handmade, you get more than a thing. You get someone's time. You get someone's care. You get their love in every piece.

### Scene 11 (30 words)
Young Mr. Mason picked out a wooden star. Klaus wrapped it in paper. He placed it gently in the boy's hand. "Remember," Klaus said. "Someone's hands made this for you."

### Scene 12 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason walked through the market with new eyes. He saw the candle maker. He saw the cookie baker. He saw the toy carver. Each one did their thing perfectly.

### Scene 13 (30 words)
All together, these people made something magical. No one could make the whole market alone. But together, each doing their one special thing, they created something wonderful and beautiful.

### Scene 14 (31 words)
The snow faded away. The lights grew dim. The attic came back. Mr. Mason was old again. But he still held the wooden star. The memory lived inside him.

### Scene 15 (30 words)
Mr. Mason handed the star to Riley. "Hold it," he said. "Feel the carving. Someone's hands made every tiny line. This star is sixty years old. It is still beautiful."

### Scene 16 (31 words)
Riley looked at the star. She felt something new inside her heart. She made art with her hands too! She made things with care. Maybe her art mattered. Maybe people would want it.

### Scene 17 (30 words)
"Your art is like this," said Layla kindly. "You make things by hand." "It's special because YOU made it," added Ellis. The friends saw how much Riley's art was worth.

### Scene 18 (31 words)
The friends got excited. Their market needed people who do one thing really well! Not everyone selling the same stuff. Each person bringing their best thing. Just like the Christmas market!

### Scene 19 (30 words)
Riley felt brave now. "I'll make handmade art for our market," she said. "Something special. Something made with love. Like Klaus made his stars." Her friends cheered for her.

### Scene 20 (31 words)
Mr. Mason smiled. "You are asking the right questions now," he said. "What makes YOUR market special? What will each of you bring?" The friends had so much to think about!
