## THE BUSY SATURDAY

### Scene 1 (45 words)
The four friends met outside the community center on Saturday morning. They weren't sure what to do with their free day. Before they could decide anything, several neighbors started walking toward them. It looked like everyone in the neighborhood needed help with something!

### Scene 2 (46 words)
Mrs. Patterson arrived first with a worried look. "My garage is a total mess," she said. "Can you help organize it?" Then Frances came over. "My garden needs weeding." Mr. Johnson appeared next. "Could you deliver these flyers?" The friends felt overwhelmed by all the requests.

### Scene 3 (45 words)
"We want to help everyone!" said Layla to her friends. "Let's start with the garage first." They walked to Mrs. Patterson's house together. "If we all work on it at the same time, we'll finish fast," Layla said. They crowded into the messy garage.

### Scene 4 (46 words)
Inside the garage, things got confusing quickly. Benny picked up a box, but Ellis was already sorting things from it. Riley and Layla both reached for the same lamp. Everyone kept bumping into each other. "Wait, I was organizing those!" Ellis said. "Oops, sorry!" replied Benny.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
Thirty minutes went by slowly. Mrs. Patterson came to check on them. The garage looked almost the same as before. The friends stood there feeling tired and frustrated. "How's it going?" she asked nicely. Layla sighed. "We're trying, but it's hard with everyone doing everything."

### Scene 6 (46 words)
Ellis stopped and thought about what was happening. "I think we keep getting in each other's way," he said to his friends. "What if each person did just ONE job instead of everyone doing everything?" The others considered his idea. It actually made a lot of sense.

### Scene 7 (45 words)
They split up the jobs based on strengths. Benny would carry heavy boxes because he was strong. Ellis would sort and label because he was organized. Riley would arrange things nicely because she was creative. Layla would direct everyone because she was a good leader.

### Scene 8 (46 words)
With everyone in their own role, work started again. This time felt totally different. Benny moved boxes without anyone in his way. Ellis sorted items without being interrupted. Riley made the shelves look pretty. Layla kept everything moving smoothly. No more bumping. No more confusion at all.

### Scene 9 (46 words)
The garage completely transformed. Boxes stood in neat stacks along the walls. Tools hung in organized rows. Clear paths made it easy to walk around. The friends stepped back to look at their work. "Wow!" said Riley with amazement. "We actually did it!" Everyone smiled proudly.

### Scene 10 (45 words)
Mrs. Patterson came back and couldn't believe her eyes. "This is amazing!" she said. "You figured out something really important. When everyone does what they're best at, the whole team wins. There's a name for this — it's called division of labor."

### Scene 11 (46 words)
Feeling energized by their success, the friends headed to Frances's garden. This time they planned ahead while walking. "Let's decide our jobs BEFORE we start," Layla suggested. Everyone agreed right away. Benny would do the heavy work. Ellis would organize. Riley would beautify. Layla would coordinate.

### Scene 12 (45 words)
In Frances's garden, everyone went straight to their jobs. Benny pulled out the big stubborn weeds. Riley planted flowers in beautiful patterns. Ellis kept track of what was done. Layla helped wherever she was needed. Frances watched them with surprise. "You're so organized!" she said.

### Scene 13 (46 words)
What could have taken all day was done in just one hour! The garden rows looked neat and colorful. New flowers bloomed everywhere. The friends gave each other high-fives. "Done already?" Benny laughed. "That would have taken forever if we'd all been doing the same thing!"

### Scene 14 (45 words)
Next came delivering the flyers. Ellis looked at a map and made the smartest route. He split up the streets. Layla and Riley each took nearby areas. Benny ran to the houses that were farther away. Everyone moved quickly and with purpose.

### Scene 15 (46 words)
The friends met back at their starting spot. Every single flyer had been delivered. Empty bags hung from their arms. The sun was still high in the sky. "All done!" Layla said happily. "And it's not even noon!" Three big jobs finished before lunch!

### Scene 16 (46 words)
They rested on a front porch, sharing snacks. The morning had been so productive. "That felt so different once we split up the work," Riley said. Ellis nodded in agreement. "Having my own job meant I could focus without getting confused by what everyone else was doing."

### Scene 17 (45 words)
The friends talked about their different strengths. Benny was strong and full of energy. Ellis was organized and smart. Riley was creative and artistic. Layla was a born leader. "We're a good team BECAUSE we're different," Benny realized. Their differences made them stronger.

### Scene 18 (46 words)
Layla thought about their market idea. "If we ever do our own market," she said, "we shouldn't all bring the same things." Their lemonade lesson and today's experience both showed the same truth. Different strengths meant different contributions. That's how good teams really worked.

### Scene 19 (46 words)
The friends imagined what their Community Market could look like. "I could make crafts to sell!" Riley said excitedly. "I could keep track of everything," Ellis offered. "I could help carry and set up," added Benny. "And I could organize the whole thing," Layla said.

### Scene 20 (46 words)
Layla leaned in with excitement. "We work so well together now," she said. "What if we actually DID something big? Like a real Community Market for the whole neighborhood?" The idea felt closer than ever. But first, they needed to learn more about how markets worked.
