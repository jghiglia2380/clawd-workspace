## THE MORNING MARKET

### Scene 1 (45 words)
Mr. Mason picked up a small decorative fishing net from the trunk. It was delicate and pretty, woven with blue thread. "This came from a fishing village by the sea," he said thoughtfully. "In Morocco, I learned patience. But in this village, I learned to move FAST."

### Scene 2 (46 words)
The familiar attic faded away around them. Blue sky appeared overhead. White buildings with bright colored doors sparkled in the early light. The shimmering sea stretched out before them. Small colorful boats bobbed in a little harbor. They had traveled to a Mediterranean fishing village at dawn.

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Fishing boats returned to the harbor very early in the morning. The sun was barely coming up over the water. Fishermen jumped off their boats before they were even tied. They carried heavy baskets of fish and moved with surprising speed. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry!

### Scene 4 (46 words)
An elderly fisherman waved at young Mr. Mason from the dock. His name was Costa, and his face was weathered from the sun. "You want to learn something?" Costa called out. "Then come help me! But you must move FAST. Fish waits for nobody!" He was already jogging away.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
Young Mr. Mason helped carry heavy baskets of fish up steep stone steps to the village market. Costa moved surprisingly fast for his age, never slowing down. "Every minute matters," Costa explained as they climbed. "At six in the morning, this fish is worth gold!"

### Scene 6 (46 words)
They quickly set up a stall at the village market square. Costa placed ice on the table first. Then he arranged the fish beautifully on top of the ice. Other fishermen were doing exactly the same thing all around them. Everyone was racing against time to set up.

### Scene 7 (45 words)
The first customers arrived right away, just as the sun cleared the rooftops. They wanted the freshest fish available. Costa greeted them by name and sold quickly. The early customers paid full price without complaining. They understood that the best and freshest fish always goes first.

### Scene 8 (46 words)
For the next two hours, they were incredibly busy with a steady stream of customers. Young Mr. Mason learned to weigh fish on a hanging scale. He learned to wrap fish in brown paper. He practiced making change quickly. It was intense and exciting, like a wonderful adventure!

### Scene 9 (45 words)
By noon, everything slowed down noticeably. The sun climbed high and made the air hot. The ice beneath the fish was melting steadily. Fewer customers came by to shop. Costa looked at the remaining fish with a concerned expression. Time was not on their side anymore.

### Scene 10 (46 words)
A late customer wandered over, looking for a bargain. Costa offered the remaining fish at half the morning price. "Better to sell cheap than throw away," he explained practically. "This morning this fish was ten coins. Now it is five. Tonight it would be garbage worth nothing."

### Scene 11 (45 words)
While they cleaned up the empty stall, Costa shared an important lesson. "Some things cannot wait," he said wisely. "Fish spoils. Opportunities can pass you by. You must learn when to be patient and calm... but also when to RUN with all your energy."

### Scene 12 (46 words)
As the sun set over the water, Costa gave young Mr. Mason a small decorative net from his boat. "Keep this to remember me," Costa said warmly. "Timing is everything in life. Not too early, not too late. Finding the right moment is the real secret."

### Scene 13 (45 words)
The beautiful seaside village slowly faded away. The blue water turned into the warm browns of the attic. Mr. Mason was old again, but he still held that same little net in his hands. The memory of Costa and his wisdom lived on inside him.

### Scene 14 (46 words)
The friends sat quietly, thinking about what they had just learned. "So patience isn't always the right answer?" one of them asked thoughtfully. Mr. Mason nodded with a gentle smile. "Neither is rushing. Real wisdom means knowing the difference and reading each situation you face."

### Scene 15 (47 words)
Benny spoke up with unusual thoughtfulness. He was always wanting to act fast and get things done. "So sometimes I SHOULD move fast?" he asked with new understanding. "And other times I should wait?" Mr. Mason smiled warmly. "Now you are truly learning, Benny. Context matters."

### Scene 16 (45 words)
Ellis helped explain the concept further. "Fish goes bad very quickly, so Costa had to sell fast before it spoiled. But other things can afford to wait. A good deal doesn't spoil from waiting an extra minute. You have to understand what you're dealing with."

### Scene 17 (46 words)
The friends applied this lesson to their Community Market plans. "If we sell food, it has to be fresh," said Riley, thinking it through. "But crafts and art don't spoil," Layla added wisely. "Baked goods need to sell fast. Paintings can wait for the right buyer."

### Scene 18 (45 words)
Benny nodded slowly, more serious than usual. "I'm good at moving fast," he admitted. "That can really help with some things. But I promise to try slowing down when the situation needs it." Layla smiled. "That's really smart thinking, Benny. Costa would be proud of you."

### Scene 19 (46 words)
Mr. Mason smiled warmly at their growing wisdom. "You have heard many stories from my trunk now," he said. "Morocco. Japan. Italy. The Mediterranean sea. But there are still more treasures inside to discover. And don't forget — Frances has her own stories to tell you."

### Scene 20 (47 words)
The friends were filled with excitement and anticipation. They had learned about patience from Hassan. They learned about competition from the auction. They learned about family work from the bakery. Now they understood timing from Costa. Their Community Market vision kept growing richer! "Keep going!" everyone said eagerly.
