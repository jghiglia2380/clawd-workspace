## THE MORNING MARKET

### Scene 1 (31 words)
Mr. Mason picked up a small fishing net. It was pretty, with blue thread. "This came from a fishing village by the sea," he said. "A place where time worked differently."

### Scene 2 (30 words)
The attic faded away. Blue sky appeared. White buildings sparkled in the sun. The sea was bright and shiny. Small boats sat in a little harbor. They were in a fishing village!

### Scene 3 (31 words)
Fishing boats came back to shore very early. The sun was just coming up. Men jumped off the boats. They moved very fast. They carried baskets of fish. Everyone was rushing around!

### Scene 4 (30 words)
An old fisherman waved at young Mr. Mason. His name was Costa. "You want to help?" Costa called. "Then move fast! Fish wait for no one!" He was already running.

### Scene 5 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason helped carry fish baskets. They walked up steep stone steps. Costa moved fast even though he was old. "Every minute matters," Costa said. "This fish is worth gold right now!"

### Scene 6 (30 words)
They set up a stall at the market. They put ice on the table. They put fish on top of the ice. It looked beautiful. Other fishermen were setting up too.

### Scene 7 (31 words)
The first customers came right away. They wanted the freshest fish. Costa sold to them quickly. They paid full price. They knew the best fish goes first. Everyone was happy.

### Scene 8 (30 words)
For two hours, they were very busy. Young Mr. Mason learned to weigh fish. He learned to wrap fish in paper. He made change for people. It was exciting!

### Scene 9 (31 words)
By noon, things slowed down. The sun was high and hot. The ice was melting. Fewer people came. Costa looked at the fish that was left. He looked a little worried.

### Scene 10 (30 words)
A late customer came by. Costa sold the last fish for half price. "Better to sell cheap than throw away," he said. "This morning it was ten. Now it is five."

### Scene 11 (31 words)
Costa explained while they cleaned up. "Some things don't wait," he said. "Fish goes bad. You must know when to be patient. But you also must know when to move fast."

### Scene 12 (30 words)
Costa gave young Mr. Mason a small net as a gift. "Remember this," Costa said. "Timing is everything. Not too early. Not too late. The right moment matters most."

### Scene 13 (31 words)
The seaside village faded away. The attic came back. Mr. Mason was old again. He held the same little net. The memory of Costa stayed with him. It always would.

### Scene 14 (30 words)
The friends were quiet. They were thinking. "So patience is not always right?" one asked. Mr. Mason nodded. "Neither is rushing. The trick is knowing when to do which."

### Scene 15 (31 words)
Benny spoke up. He was always wanting to act fast. "So sometimes I SHOULD move fast?" he asked. "And sometimes I should wait?" Mr. Mason smiled. "Now you are learning."

### Scene 16 (30 words)
Ellis helped explain. "Fish goes bad quickly. So Costa had to sell fast. But other things can wait. You have to read the situation. Think about what you are selling."

### Scene 17 (31 words)
The friends thought about their Community Market. "Food has to be fresh," said Riley. "But crafts don't spoil," said Layla. "Art can wait. Cookies cannot." They were learning so much!

### Scene 18 (30 words)
Benny nodded slowly. "I am good at moving fast," he said. "That can help sometimes. But I will try to slow down when I need to." That was very wise.

### Scene 19 (31 words)
Mr. Mason smiled at them. "You have heard many stories," he said. "Morocco. Japan. Italy. The sea. But there are more treasures in this trunk. And Frances has stories too."

### Scene 20 (31 words)
The friends were excited. They had learned about patience. They had learned about competition. They had learned about family work and timing. Their Community Market would be amazing! "Keep going!" said Layla.
