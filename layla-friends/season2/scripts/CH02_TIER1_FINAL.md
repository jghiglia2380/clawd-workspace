## THE LEMONADE PROBLEM

### Scene 1 (30 words)
It was a very hot day. Layla sat by her window. She was so warm! "Everyone must be thirsty," she thought. "I should sell lemonade!" That was a good idea.

### Scene 2 (31 words)
Layla went to the kitchen. She squeezed lemons into a pitcher. She added sugar and water. She stirred and stirred. The lemonade looked yummy. "This will sell fast!" said Layla with a smile.

### Scene 3 (30 words)
Layla set up a table in her yard. She put out cups. She made a sign. It said: "LEMONADE 50¢." Everything looked nice. Now she needed people to come buy some.

### Scene 4 (30 words)
Layla looked down the street. She saw another lemonade stand! It was Riley's stand! "Wait," said Layla. "Riley had the same idea?" She was very surprised to see that.

### Scene 5 (31 words)
Layla walked down the street. She counted more stands. Riley had one. Ellis had one. Benny had one. Other kids had them too! "Six lemonade stands!" cried Layla. "That's too many!"

### Scene 6 (30 words)
Layla went back to her stand. She waited a long time. People walked by. But nobody stopped. Nobody wanted lemonade. Layla felt sad. Why was no one buying from her?

### Scene 7 (30 words)
Layla walked to Riley's stand. "Did you sell any?" Layla asked. Riley shook her head. "Not one cup," said Riley. They both looked confused. It was so hot outside!

### Scene 8 (31 words)
Ellis and Benny came over. Nobody had sold anything. "I don't get it," said Benny. "Everyone should be thirsty!" Ellis looked at all the stands. He started thinking very hard about it.

### Scene 9 (30 words)
Ellis counted the stands again. "Six stands," he said. "But not many people walking by. There's too much lemonade!" He was starting to understand what the problem was now.

### Scene 10 (31 words)
"We're all trying to sell to the same people," said Ellis. "But there aren't enough people for all of us." The friends nodded. That made sense. Too many stands, not enough buyers!

### Scene 11 (30 words)
Another kid changed their sign. The price went down to 25 cents. "Look!" said Layla. "They made it cheaper!" Maybe that would help them get more customers to stop and buy.

### Scene 12 (30 words)
Soon everyone lowered their prices. 25 cents. 20 cents. 15 cents. The signs kept changing. Everyone wanted to be the cheapest. But still, not many people were buying any lemonade at all.

### Scene 13 (31 words)
"This is bad," said Benny. "Now lemonade costs almost nothing. And still no one is buying!" Riley agreed. "We need a different plan." Making things cheaper wasn't working at all for them.

### Scene 14 (30 words)
Layla had a new idea. "What if we work together?" she said. "One big stand instead of six small ones!" Her friends looked at each other. That might actually work!

### Scene 15 (30 words)
The friends put all their things together. More lemons. More cups. One big table. "We have so much now!" said Benny. They had enough lemonade for a real business together.

### Scene 16 (31 words)
Riley made a pretty new sign. Ellis put the cups in rows. Benny set up the table. Layla added lemon slices to the pitcher. Everyone helped. The stand looked really amazing now!

### Scene 17 (30 words)
The new stand was beautiful. People walking by stopped to look. "Fresh lemonade!" the friends called out. "Made by friends!" The stand was so nice that people wanted to buy now!

### Scene 18 (30 words)
People started buying lemonade! The friends worked as a team. One poured. One took money. It was fun! "This is so much better!" said Benny happily. Business was finally good!

### Scene 19 (31 words)
The sun went down. The friends counted their coins. They made more money together than alone. Ellis smiled. "When there's too much of something, it doesn't sell. But together, we're special!"

### Scene 20 (30 words)
"For our market, we shouldn't all sell the same thing," said Layla. "We need different things!" The friends agreed. If everyone brings something different, everyone can do well at the market!
