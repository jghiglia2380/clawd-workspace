## EL MERCADO DE LOS MUERTOS

### Scene 1 (30 words)
The friends visited Frances on her front porch. The afternoon sun was warm and golden. "We have learned a lot about markets," said Layla. "But something still feels missing."

### Scene 2 (31 words)
Frances nodded with understanding. "You have learned how markets work," she said. "Now you need to learn why they matter." She settled back in her rocking chair. "Let me tell you a story."

### Scene 3 (30 words)
Frances's eyes got soft and far away. "When I was nine, my abuelita took me to Mexico," she began. "We went to a very special market. Close your eyes. Smell the flowers."

### Scene 4 (31 words)
The porch faded away. Bright colors appeared everywhere. Orange and purple and gold! They were in a Mexican town square. Flowers filled every corner. This was the market before Día de los Muertos.

### Scene 5 (30 words)
Young Frances held her grandmother's hand. Her eyes were wide with wonder. "Abuelita, why is everything so orange?" she asked. "That color guides them home, mija," said her grandmother softly.

### Scene 6 (31 words)
They walked to a flower stall. Mountains of orange marigolds filled the air with sweet smell. The vendor smiled at Abuelita. "Doña Elena! Your flowers are waiting!" They knew each other well.

### Scene 7 (30 words)
Young Frances asked why they needed so many flowers. Abuelita explained gently. "The bright color and sweet smell guide the spirits home. These are not just pretty. They are a path."

### Scene 8 (31 words)
They visited a woman making sugar skulls. She decorated each one with a name. "Tell me their names," she said. "I write them here so they know we remember." Abuelita said three names.

### Scene 9 (30 words)
Young Frances realized these were not just candy. They were tributes. Each skull was for someone who had died. Someone's grandmother. Someone's child. Someone loved. She touched one very gently.

### Scene 10 (31 words)
They bought candles for the ofrenda at home. "Each flame is a prayer," the vendor said. "Your prayer is the light that guides them through the dark night." Young Frances listened carefully.

### Scene 11 (30 words)
They bought pan de muerto from the bakery. Special bread shaped like bones. The baker gave young Frances a taste. It was sweet. "We bake with our hands what we carry in our hearts."

### Scene 12 (31 words)
As they walked, Abuelita shared something important. "Everything here was made by hand with love," she said. "That is what gives these things power. The hands put the heart inside."

### Scene 13 (30 words)
Young Frances helped pick papel picado and fabric. She chose purple and gold. "These were Abuelo's favorite colors," she said. "I want him to see them and know we remember him."

### Scene 14 (31 words)
Later, the family built their ofrenda together. They placed flowers, candles, photos, skulls, and bread. Everyone helped. It was not for money. It was not for praise. It was for love.

### Scene 15 (30 words)
The memory faded softly. Frances was back on her porch. The friends were quiet. Some things are not made to be sold. They are made to mean something very important.

### Scene 16 (31 words)
Benny sat very still. This was not like him. His eyes were wet. "I never thought about who we remember," he said quietly. "It is not silly at all. It is important."

### Scene 17 (30 words)
Riley had been drawing while she listened. She looked up with excitement. "What if our market had something like that?" she asked nervously. "We could make things that mean something."

### Scene 18 (31 words)
The friends encouraged her. Riley showed her sketch. Paper marigolds. Memory cards. A place where people could honor someone special. "You should lead this part," said Layla. "You see it clearly."

### Scene 19 (30 words)
Riley smiled with new confidence. She had shared her idea, and people liked it! She could lead the memory station at their Community Market. Her creativity mattered. Her vision was valued.

### Scene 20 (31 words)
Frances watched them with warm eyes. "Now you understand," she said. "The market is not just about trading things. It is about sharing what matters most." The friends finally understood deeply.
