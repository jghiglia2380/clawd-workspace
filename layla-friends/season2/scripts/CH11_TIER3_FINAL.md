## EL MERCADO DE LOS MUERTOS

### Scene 1 (50 words)
The friends visited Frances on her comfortable front porch in the late afternoon. The autumn sun was warm and golden, casting long shadows across the wooden boards. "We have learned so much about markets," said Layla thoughtfully. "Value, timing, teamwork. But something still feels missing from our plans."

### Scene 2 (51 words)
Frances nodded with deep understanding in her eyes. "You have learned how markets work," she said gently. "Now you need to learn why they truly matter. The heart beneath all the trading." She settled back in her old rocking chair with a knowing smile. "Let me tell you a story."

### Scene 3 (50 words)
Frances's eyes got soft and far away, seeing another time and place. "When I was nine years old, my abuelita took me to Mexico for something very special," she began slowly. "We went to a market unlike any other. Close your eyes. Smell the marigolds. Hear the prayers."

### Scene 4 (51 words)
The porch faded away around them like morning mist clearing. Bright, vivid colors appeared everywhere they looked. Orange and purple and gold! They stood in a Mexican town square transformed by celebration. Flowers filled every corner and doorway. This was the market before Día de los Muertos — the Day of the Dead.

### Scene 5 (50 words)
Young Frances held her grandmother's weathered hand tightly. Her eyes were wide with wonder at the overwhelming beauty around her. "Abuelita, why is everything so orange?" she asked with curiosity. "That color guides them home, mija," said her grandmother softly, squeezing her hand. "The spirits follow the brightness back."

### Scene 6 (51 words)
They walked to a flower stall overflowing with magnificent blooms. Mountains of orange marigolds called cempasúchil filled the air with their sweet, powerful smell. The vendor smiled warmly at Abuelita like greeting an old friend. "Doña Elena! Your flowers are waiting for you!" They knew each other from many years past.

### Scene 7 (50 words)
Young Frances asked why they needed so many bright flowers for just one night. Abuelita explained gently, kneeling down to look into her eyes. "The bright color and sweet smell guide the spirits home to visit us. These are not just pretty decorations. They are a path of love."

### Scene 8 (51 words)
They visited a woman carefully crafting sugar skulls called calaveras at her artisan stall. She decorated each one with names written in colorful icing with steady hands. "Tell me their names," she said kindly. "I write them here so they know we remember and love them always." Abuelita whispered three precious names.

### Scene 9 (50 words)
Young Frances suddenly understood something profound. These were not candy treats to eat casually. They were tributes to honor the dead with beauty and care. Each decorated skull represented someone who had passed away. Someone's grandmother. Someone's child. Someone deeply loved and missed. She touched one gently with reverence.

### Scene 10 (51 words)
They bought tall candles for the ofrenda they would build together at home. "Each flame is a prayer," the candle vendor explained with quiet reverence. "Your prayer is the light that guides them through the dark night." Young Frances listened carefully, understanding that even a small flame held powerful meaning.

### Scene 11 (50 words)
They bought pan de muerto from the warm bakery that smelled like sugar and yeast. This special bread was shaped with bone patterns on top. The kind baker gave young Frances a small taste. It was sweet and wonderful on her tongue. "We bake with our hands what we carry in our hearts."

### Scene 12 (51 words)
As they walked through the crowded, joyful market, Abuelita shared something deeply important. "Everything here was made by hand with love and intention," she explained meaningfully. "That is what gives these things their special power. The hands that made them put their hearts inside every piece, every petal, every brushstroke."

### Scene 13 (50 words)
Young Frances helped pick papel picado — colorful cut paper banners with intricate designs. She also chose fabric for their home ofrenda with care. She picked purple and gold specifically. "These were Abuelo's favorite colors," she said with determination. "I want him to see them and know we remember him."

### Scene 14 (51 words)
Later that evening, the whole family built their ofrenda together as they did every year. They placed flowers, candles, photos, decorated skulls, and bread with loving care. Everyone helped, from the oldest grandmother to the youngest child. They were not creating this for money or praise. They were creating it for love.

### Scene 15 (50 words)
The memory faded softly like candlelight dimming at dawn. Frances was back on her porch, and the friends sat around her in thoughtful silence. Some things are not made to be sold for any amount of money. They are made to mean something important. To remember. To honor. To love.

### Scene 16 (51 words)
Benny sat very still on the porch steps, which was unusual for his restless energy. His eyes were wet with unexpected feeling. "I never thought about who we remember," he said quietly, his voice different than before. "About why it really matters. It is not silly at all. It is important."

### Scene 17 (50 words)
Riley had been sketching in her notebook while she listened to every word of the story. Now she looked up with excitement mixed with nervous energy. "What if our market had something like that?" she asked hopefully. "We could make things that mean something special. Things that share love."

### Scene 18 (51 words)
The friends leaned in to encourage her warmly. Riley showed them her sketch with trembling but proud hands. Paper marigolds made from orange tissue paper. Memory cards to write someone's name. A special corner where people could honor someone they love. "You should lead this part, Riley," said Layla with admiration.

### Scene 19 (50 words)
Riley smiled with new confidence blooming inside her chest. She had shared her creative vision, and people truly liked it! She could lead the memory station at their Community Market. Her creativity mattered to others. Her artistic vision was valued and wanted. For the first time, she felt like a leader.

### Scene 20 (51 words)
Frances watched them with warm, proud eyes that held generations of wisdom. "Now you understand the heart of it," she said gently. "The market is not just about trading things for money. It is about sharing what matters most to your heart." The friends finally understood value beyond any price.
