## LA TAMALADA & THE COMMUNITY MARKET

### Scene 1 (45 words)
It was the morning of the big day. The friends went to Frances's warm kitchen very early. The counter was covered with ingredients to make tamales — masa dough, corn husks, chilies, and meat. Frances smiled at them warmly. "Before your market opens, I have one more lesson."

### Scene 2 (46 words)
"My grandmother taught me this many years ago," Frances said with love in her voice. "A tamalada is not just making food. It is a whole family working together to create something no one person could make alone. Today, you are my family. Let's begin together."

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Frances got a faraway look in her eyes. She remembered her own childhood tamalada. Many hands working at the same time. Laughter filling the busy kitchen. Her abuela guiding everyone with patience. Then she looked at the eager friends. "My abuela used to say: one person cannot make enough tamales."

### Scene 4 (46 words)
Frances gave each friend a special job at their own station. Riley would spread the masa dough smooth and even. Ellis would add the filling in just the right amount. Benny would wrap them up tight. Layla would check that each one was done correctly. An assembly line!

### Scene 5 (45 words)
At first, making tamales was really hard. Riley's masa was bumpy and uneven. Benny wrapped too loose and they fell apart. Ellis put in too much filling. But Frances did not get upset at all. "Wrong is how you learn," she said kindly. "Again. And again."

### Scene 6 (46 words)
They kept trying with determination. Soon they found their rhythm together. Riley's masa got smooth and perfect. Ellis used exactly the right amount of filling. Benny's wraps got tight and neat. Layla caught problems before they got worse. They were working together beautifully as a real team!

### Scene 7 (45 words)
Frances stopped them to look at what they had made. "See? None of you could make these all alone," she said proudly. "But together, look what you created!" Dozens of perfect tamales were lined up and ready. Together they had done something amazing.

### Scene 8 (46 words)
The tamales went into a big pot to steam. While they waited, Frances shared wisdom. "This is what collaboration means," she said. "Each person is essential. Each job is important and respected. Together you create abundance. Remember this always." The friends nodded, understanding deeply this time.

### Scene 9 (45 words)
The friends excitedly talked about their market plan while the tamales steamed. They had a swap area for trading. An auction corner for special items. Riley's craft station with paper marigolds and memory cards. A tribute corner to honor loved ones. Frances listened and added helpful ideas.

### Scene 10 (46 words)
Frances carefully opened the steaming pot. Wonderful steam rose up smelling like home. The tamales were absolutely perfect! "These carry more than just food," she said meaningfully. "They carry everything you learned this whole season. Share them wisely today. Now go make your market beautiful and full of love."

### Scene 11 (45 words)
At the neighborhood park, they set up their Community Market. Neighbors came to help carry tables and set up chairs. Everyone brought something special to share or trade. Layla smiled wide. "This is really happening!" Mrs. Patterson waved happily. "Wouldn't miss it for the world!"

### Scene 12 (46 words)
The market had many different areas, each reflecting something they had learned. A place to swap things fairly. A corner for auctions. Riley's craft station with paper marigolds. A special memory corner for honoring loved ones. The tamales stayed warm. Everything they had learned all season was here!

### Scene 13 (45 words)
Two neighbors could not agree on a fair trade. They were getting frustrated with each other. Layla stepped in calmly, not rushing. She listened carefully to both of them. She helped them see each other's point of view. They made a fair trade happily. Layla had learned patience.

### Scene 14 (46 words)
Ellis ran the auction corner with confidence. He explained the rules clearly so everyone understood. He kept careful track of all the bids on his clipboard. He made sure everything was completely fair. His careful thinking made the whole system work smoothly. He felt proud and valuable.

### Scene 15 (45 words)
Riley led the memory station beautifully. Families gathered to make paper flowers and memory cards together. "Can I make one for my grandpa?" asked a young child hopefully. "Of course you can," said Riley with a warm smile. "I will show you how. What colors did he love?"

### Scene 16 (46 words)
A shy little kid stood alone near the memory corner. Benny noticed him looking uncertain. He walked over quietly and knelt down to the child's level. "It's okay to miss people," Benny said gently with kindness. "Making something for them really helps. Would you like to sit with me?"

### Scene 17 (45 words)
Frances and the friends shared the tamales with everyone. Not sold for money — shared freely with love. Neighbors tasted and smiled with delight. "These are wonderful!" someone said. "How did you make them?" Frances smiled warmly. "I didn't make them. We made them together. As a family."

### Scene 18 (46 words)
Mr. Mason arrived at the market, leaning on his cane with a smile. He looked around at everything carefully. The auction corner. The crafts. The memory corner. The happy community. His eyes got wet with emotion. "You listened. You learned. You made it your own. I am so proud."

### Scene 19 (45 words)
A young kid ran up to the friends with excitement. "That was so cool!" he said. "Can you teach me how to do this next year?" The friends looked at each other and smiled with understanding. The cycle was continuing. They could teach now.

### Scene 20 (46 words)
The sun was setting golden over the park. People went home happy with treasures and memories in their arms. Layla said quietly, "We did not just have a market today. We shared everything we learned." They were no longer just learners. Now they were teachers ready to pass it on.
