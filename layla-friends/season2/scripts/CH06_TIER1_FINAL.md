## THE FISH AUCTION

### Scene 1 (31 words)
Mr. Mason looked in the trunk. He found a small wooden fish. It was pretty. "This is from Japan," he said. "Have you ever heard of an auction?" The friends shook their heads.

### Scene 2 (30 words)
The attic started to fade. Now they could see a big building. It was a fish market. It was very early in the morning. The sky was still dark outside.

### Scene 3 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason walked into the market. He saw huge fish on the floor. They were giant tuna! Some were bigger than him. Workers looked at the fish with flashlights.

### Scene 4 (30 words)
He found a special area. Many people stood around the fish. They wore special hats. A bell rang. Everyone got quiet. Something big was about to happen here.

### Scene 5 (31 words)
A man stood up front. He was the auctioneer. He talked very fast in Japanese. Young Mr. Mason did not know the words. But he watched the buyers very closely.

### Scene 6 (30 words)
Hands went up. Fingers showed numbers. The buyers were bidding. They all wanted the same fish! They were trying to win. It was like a race, but with money.

### Scene 7 (31 words)
Two buyers really wanted one fish. They kept bidding higher. The price went up and up. Young Mr. Mason was amazed. One fish could cost so much money! This was exciting.

### Scene 8 (30 words)
One buyer finally won. The other one stopped. A bell rang. The winner bowed. The fish got a special mark. Everyone clapped. The fish was sold to the winner.

### Scene 9 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason talked to a buyer. "Who decides the price?" he asked. The man laughed. "We do!" he said. "The buyers decide. Not the seller. We make the price."

### Scene 10 (30 words)
The buyer explained more. "In an auction, buyers fight with prices. Whoever wants it most pays the most." Young Mr. Mason nodded. This was different from the spice market. Very different.

### Scene 11 (31 words)
Young Mr. Mason looked around the market. He saw it now. When many people want something, the price goes up. When no one wants it, the price goes down. Smart!

### Scene 12 (30 words)
He found a small shop. They sold little carved fish. He bought a wooden fish to remember today. Every time he saw it, he would think about auctions and prices.

### Scene 13 (31 words)
The fish market started to fade. The colors got soft. They were back in the attic. Mr. Mason still held the wooden fish. It was the same one from the story.

### Scene 14 (30 words)
The friends were amazed. "So when lots of people want something, the price goes up?" asked Benny. "Exactly!" said Mr. Mason. He put the fish back in the trunk.

### Scene 15 (32 words)
Ellis spoke up. "Wait! That's the opposite of the lemonade!" Everyone looked at him. "We had too many sellers. At the auction, there were too many buyers. It made prices go different ways!"

### Scene 16 (30 words)
The friends stared at Ellis. "That's so smart," said Layla. "You are good at figuring things out." Ellis smiled. He felt proud. His thinking helped the group understand.

### Scene 17 (31 words)
"Could we have an auction?" asked Riley. "At our market?" The friends got excited. "People could bid on special things!" They could use play money. That would be so fun!

### Scene 18 (30 words)
Ellis took out a small notebook. He wrote down the idea. "An auction," he said. "And fair prices." He was keeping track of all their ideas. He liked being organized.

### Scene 19 (31 words)
Mr. Mason smiled at them. "There are more things in this trunk," he said. "More stories from markets around the world. Italy. Germany. Each one teaches something new about buying and selling."

### Scene 20 (32 words)
The friends could not wait. Every story was teaching them something. They would use these lessons for their Community Market. "Keep going!" said Layla. "We want to learn everything!" Mr. Mason nodded happily.
