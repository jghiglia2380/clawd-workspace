Frances got a special look in her eyes. It was the look people get when they remember something nice. "I do have a story," she said. "Let me tell you about Doña Carmen."

### Scene 6 (30 words)
The garden seemed to shimmer. Colors changed. Now they saw an old neighborhood. The houses looked different. The cars looked old. This was from a long time ago.

### Scene 7 (31 words)
A little girl walked down the street. It was young Frances! She had coins in her pocket. Her mama had sent her to buy tomatoes. She knew just where to go.

### Scene 8 (30 words)
Young Frances came to a house. A small table sat in the front yard. Tomatoes, peppers, and herbs lay on the table. An old woman stood there. Her name was Doña Carmen.

### Scene 9 (31 words)
"Hola, Francesita!" said Doña Carmen with a warm smile. She knew everyone in the neighborhood. "How is your mama? How is school?" She cared about the little girl. They were neighbors.

### Scene 10 (30 words)
Doña Carmen helped young Frances pick the best tomatoes. "Feel this one," she said. "See how it gives a little? That means it is ready. This other one needs more time."

Young Frances walked home. She could see Doña Carmen's garden from the street. She knew exactly where her tomatoes grew. She knew who planted them. She knew who picked them.

### Scene 13 (31 words)
This was different from a big store. At the store, you do not know anyone. At Doña Carmen's, you are like family. Mama trusted Doña Carmen. That trust was very special.

Frances had an idea. "What would YOU sell at a stand?" she asked. "What would you make or grow or share? How would you treat your neighbors? Think about it."

### Scene 19 (31 words)
The friends got excited. "I would do art!" said Riley. "I could help organize!" said Ellis. "I am good at carrying heavy things!" said Benny. Layla was not sure yet.
