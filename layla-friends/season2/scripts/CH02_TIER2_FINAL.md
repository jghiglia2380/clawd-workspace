## THE LEMONADE PROBLEM

### Scene 1 (45 words)
Layla sat by her window on a very hot summer day. The sun blazed outside and heat shimmered off the sidewalk. She fanned herself with a piece of paper. "Everyone must be so thirsty today," she thought. A lemonade stand would be perfect!

### Scene 2 (46 words)
Layla went to the kitchen with excitement. She found lemons and squeezed them into a big pitcher. She added sugar and cold water, then stirred until it looked just right. The lemonade was bright yellow and refreshing. "This is going to sell out fast!" she said happily.

### Scene 3 (45 words)
Layla carried a small table to her front yard. She arranged cups in neat rows and placed her pitcher in the middle. She made a colorful sign that said "LEMONADE 50¢" with lemon drawings around the edges. Everything looked perfect. Now she waited for customers.

### Scene 4 (46 words)
Layla looked up from her stand and saw something surprising. Down the street, another lemonade stand was being set up. She squinted to see better. "Wait — is that Riley?" she said out loud. Riley had the exact same idea! This was unexpected.

### Scene 5 (45 words)
Layla walked down the sidewalk to see what was happening. Her eyes got wider with each step. Riley had a stand. Ellis had a stand. Benny had a stand. Other neighborhood kids had stands too. She counted six lemonade stands on one street!

### Scene 6 (46 words)
Layla went back to her stand and waited. An hour passed slowly by. A few people walked past on the sidewalk, but nobody stopped to buy. They seemed overwhelmed by choices. Layla rested her chin in her hands and stared at her full pitcher.

### Scene 7 (46 words)
Layla walked to Riley's stand to see how she was doing. Riley looked just as confused. "Have you sold any lemonade?" Layla asked hopefully. Riley shook her head. "Not one single cup! I don't understand — it's so hot today!" Something was definitely wrong.

### Scene 8 (45 words)
Ellis and Benny joined them in the middle of the street. Everyone had the same problem — lots of lemonade but zero sales. "I thought everyone would be thirsty!" said Benny with frustration. Ellis looked around at all the stands, thinking hard about the situation.

### Scene 9 (46 words)
Ellis counted the stands and then counted the people walking by. "Let me figure this out," he said slowly. "Six stands, but maybe only twenty people passing by. That's not very many customers for each of us." He was starting to see the problem clearly now.

### Scene 10 (46 words)
"I think I understand," Ellis said to his friends. "There's too much lemonade and not enough people who want it. We're all trying to sell to the same small group!" The friends nodded as it started making sense. Too much supply, not enough demand.

### Scene 11 (45 words)
Layla noticed another kid changing their price sign. Fifty cents became twenty-five cents. "Look at that!" she pointed out. "They're making it cheaper to get more customers." The idea seemed clever. Maybe lower prices would bring more people to their stands?

### Scene 12 (46 words)
Soon everyone was dropping their prices. Twenty-five cents. Then twenty cents. Then fifteen cents. Signs changed all over the street. Kids tried to be the cheapest option. But even with lower prices, people still weren't buying very much. The pricing war wasn't helping anyone.

### Scene 13 (46 words)
The friends gathered together, feeling frustrated. "This is terrible," Benny groaned. "Now we're giving lemonade away for almost nothing, and still nobody's buying!" Riley crossed her arms. "There has to be a better idea." Just lowering prices wasn't solving anything at all.

### Scene 14 (45 words)
Layla's face lit up with a new idea. "What if we stopped competing against each other?" she suggested. "Instead of six small stands, we could make ONE amazing stand together!" Her friends thought about it. Working together might change everything for the better.

### Scene 15 (46 words)
The four friends brought all their supplies to Layla's yard. They combined their lemons, their pitchers, and their cups. Together they had way more than any one stand. "We can make so much more together!" Ellis said with excitement. One stand to rule them all.

### Scene 16 (45 words)
Each friend helped build the new stand. Riley painted a beautiful colorful sign. Ellis organized everything for fast service. Benny arranged the cups in a nice display. Layla added fresh lemon slices floating in the pitchers. Everyone contributed their special talent to the project.

### Scene 17 (46 words)
Their combined stand looked amazing. The big colorful sign caught people's attention from down the street. The setup looked professional and inviting. People actually stopped to look! "Fresh lemonade!" the friends called out together. "Made by friends, for friends!" The energy was completely different.

### Scene 18 (46 words)
Customers finally started buying. Without so many competing stands, their impressive setup became the clear choice. The friends worked as a team — pouring lemonade, taking money, thanking each customer. "This is so much better than before!" one customer said. Business was finally good!

### Scene 19 (45 words)
The sun started going down. The friends counted their money together. They had made more working together than they ever would have alone. Ellis smiled at the lesson. "When there's too much of something, nobody wins. But together, we became something special."

### Scene 20 (46 words)
Layla thought about their Community Market idea. "For our market, we shouldn't all bring the same things," she realized. "If everyone sells lemonade, nobody does well. But if everyone brings something different, there's no competition!" Variety would be the key to their success.
