## THE BUSY SATURDAY

### Scene 1 (30 words)
The friends met on Saturday morning. They did not know what to do yet. Then some neighbors came over. The neighbors needed help with things. Everyone wanted help today!

### Scene 2 (31 words)
Mrs. Patterson said, "My garage is messy. Can you help?" Frances said, "My garden has weeds." Mr. Johnson said, "Can you give out these papers?" The friends had a lot to do!

### Scene 3 (30 words)
"Let's help everyone!" said Layla. They went to the garage first. "We can all work on it together," she said. The four friends went inside. The garage was very messy.

### Scene 4 (30 words)
Everyone started working. But it was hard! Benny moved a box. Ellis was using it. Riley and Layla grabbed the same lamp. They kept bumping into each other. Nothing was working well.

### Scene 5 (31 words)
Time went by slowly. The garage still looked messy. Mrs. Patterson came to look. "How is it going?" she asked. Layla sighed. "We are trying. But it's hard to work like this."

### Scene 6 (30 words)
Ellis had an idea. "We keep getting in each other's way," he said. "What if each person did ONE job?" The friends stopped to think. That might work a lot better!

### Scene 7 (31 words)
They gave each person a job. Benny would carry heavy boxes. He was strong. Ellis would sort things. He was neat. Riley would make things look nice. Layla would be the leader.

### Scene 8 (30 words)
Now everyone had their own job. They started working again. This time was different. No more bumping. No more grabbing the same thing. Everyone knew what to do. It felt much better!

### Scene 9 (30 words)
The garage looked amazing! Boxes were in neat piles. Tools hung on the wall. There was room to walk. "We did it!" said Riley. The friends were so proud of themselves.

### Scene 10 (31 words)
Mrs. Patterson came back. "Wow!" she said. "This is great!" She smiled at them. "When each person does what they are good at, the team works better." The friends nodded happily.

### Scene 11 (30 words)
Now they went to the garden. This time they had a plan. "Let's pick jobs before we start," said Layla. Everyone agreed. They knew what to do now. Planning helped a lot.

### Scene 12 (30 words)
In the garden, everyone worked on their job. Benny pulled big weeds. Riley planted flowers. Ellis kept track of the work. Layla helped everyone. Frances watched them work. "You are very fast!"

### Scene 13 (31 words)
The garden was done in one hour! It looked so pretty now. The friends gave high-fives. "That was so fast!" said Benny. Working with jobs was much better than everyone doing everything together.

### Scene 14 (30 words)
Next, they gave out the papers. Ellis made a plan for where to go. Everyone took a part of the neighborhood. Benny ran to the far houses. They worked fast and smart.

### Scene 15 (30 words)
They met back where they started. All the papers were gone. "All done!" said Layla. "And it's not even lunch time!" They had finished three big jobs before noon. That felt great!

### Scene 16 (31 words)
The friends sat on a porch. They ate snacks. "That was a good day," said Riley. "I liked having my own job." Ellis nodded. "I could think better when I had one job."

### Scene 17 (30 words)
They talked about their strengths. Benny was strong. Ellis was organized. Riley was creative. Layla was a good leader. "We are a good team because we are different!" said Benny with a smile.

### Scene 18 (31 words)
Layla thought about their market idea. "We should not all bring the same thing to our market," she said. "We should each bring something different!" That is what makes a team work.

### Scene 19 (30 words)
The friends imagined their market. "I could make crafts," said Riley. "I could count things," said Ellis. "I could carry stuff," said Benny. "I could run it," said Layla. Everyone had a job!

### Scene 20 (30 words)
"We work so well together," said Layla. "What if we made a REAL market?" The friends got excited. The idea was growing. But first, they needed to learn more about markets.
