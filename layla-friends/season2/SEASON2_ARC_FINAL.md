## Season Goal (Narrative Spine)

**The friends decide to host their own Community Market.**

- Introduced in **Ch 3-4**: After helping with neighborhood tasks and discovering Mr. Mason's trunk, Layla says "What if WE created something like this? Our own market where everyone shares?"
- Each chapter teaches skills they'll need
- **Ch 12** is the payoff: They host the Community Market, using everything they learned

This gives the season **forward momentum** — every episode builds toward something.
