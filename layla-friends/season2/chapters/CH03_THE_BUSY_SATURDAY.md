# Chapter 3: The Busy Saturday

## Metadata
- **Season:** 2
- **Chapter:** 3
- **Title:** The Busy Saturday
- **Type:** Neighborhood (Present)
- **Setting:** Various locations around the neighborhood
- **FL Concept:** Specialization and division of labor — each person does what they do best
- **Season Goal Setup:** Layla says "We work so well together. What if we did something BIG?"

## Story Summary
Everyone in the neighborhood needs help on the same Saturday. Mrs. Patterson needs her garage organized, Frances needs garden help, a neighbor needs flyers delivered. At first, the friends try to do everything together as a group — but it's slow and chaotic. They discover they each have different strengths, and when they split up and specialize, they accomplish way more. This teaches them about division of labor and plants the Community Market seed.
