# Chapter 1: The Swap Meet

## Metadata
- **Season:** 2
- **Chapter:** 1
- **Title:** The Swap Meet
- **Type:** Neighborhood (Present)
- **Setting:** Community center and surrounding neighborhood
- **FL Concept:** Fair trade, perceived value — what's "junk" to one person is treasure to another
- **S1 Callback:** Reference to the Trading Post from Season 1

## Story Summary
A neighbor is organizing a community swap meet at the community center. The friends help set up and participate, each bringing items they no longer need. Through the swap, they discover that value is subjective — one person's forgotten toy becomes another's treasure. The experience plants the seed for their own bigger project later in the season.

## Character Focus
- **All four friends** participate equally
- **Group dynamic:** Working as a team, seeing different perspectives on value
- Seeds the "we could do something bigger together" idea that grows through the season
