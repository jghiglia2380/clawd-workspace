## Story Summary
The season finale has two parts. **Part 1:** Frances teaches the friends to make tamales assembly-line style, sharing her family's tamalada tradition. Everyone has a role — no one person can do it all. **Part 2:** The Community Market happens. The friends share what they've made and learned. Neighbors bring items too. Everything they learned — value, timing, negotiation, specialization, collaboration — comes together. The market is part swap, part celebration, part ofrenda. The season ends with the friends realizing they're now the ones sharing knowledge.
