## Story Summary
Mr. Mason tells the story of helping a fisherman sell the morning catch in a Mediterranean village. Fish that's worth gold at dawn is worth nothing by evening — timing matters. The story teaches that some things lose value if you wait too long to act, while patience at other times is wise. It's about knowing WHEN to move fast.
