# Scene Audit Template

## Purpose
Verify that each storyboard prompt matches the script narration for that scene.

## Checklist Per Scene

For each scene, verify:

1. **CHARACTERS** - Who's in the script text? Are they ALL in the prompt?
2. **SETTING** - Where does the script say they are? Does the prompt match?
3. **ACTION** - What are they doing in the script? Does the prompt show that?
4. **OBJECTS** - What items are mentioned? Are they in the prompt?

## Rating

- ✅ **PASS** - Prompt matches script perfectly
- ⚠️ **FIX** - Minor mismatch (easy fix)
- ❌ **FAIL** - Major mismatch (image would confuse viewer)

---

## Tier 1 Scope Reminder

- Each scene: ~30 words narration
- Duration: 20-30 seconds at 75 WPM
- Image shows ONE moment that supports what's being read
- Simple, clear, no complex compositions
