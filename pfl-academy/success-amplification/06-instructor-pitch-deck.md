# Success Amplification — Instructor Pitch
## Talking Points for Conversations with Educators

---

## The Quick Version (30 seconds)

> "We're building features to help you showcase what your students accomplish. Think: shareable impact reports for your admin, student portfolios they can use for college apps, and instructor spotlights that recognize the work you're doing. We want to make you look good — and when you share those wins, it helps other educators discover PFL Academy naturally."

---

## The Conversation Framework

### 1. Start with Their Win

**Open with:**
> "One thing we've been thinking about is how to help you — and instructors like you — get more recognition for what you're doing in the classroom."

**Why this works:** You're leading with value for them, not asking for something.

---

### 2. Paint the Picture

**Explain the features:**

> "We're building a few things:
>
> First, **Impact Reports** — a professional one-pager that shows exactly what your students accomplished. Completion rates, business plans created, even the total projected revenue across all your student ventures. Something you can literally hand to your principal and say, 'This is what my class produced this semester.'
>
> Second, **Student Showcases** — a place where your students' best work can be featured publicly. They can use it for college applications, scholarships, even just to show their parents. And you get credit as their instructor.
>
> Third, **Instructor Spotlights** — profiles that highlight educators doing great work. Featured in our newsletter, on our site, shareable on LinkedIn. Recognition you've earned."

---

### 3. Make It Easy

**Address the "what do I have to do" concern:**

> "The best part? Most of this is automatic. We pull the data from what's already in the system — completion rates, assessment scores, business plan submissions. You just choose which student work to feature and whether you want to opt into the spotlight program. We do the heavy lifting."

---

### 4. Connect to Their Goals

**For different instructor motivations:**

| If They Care About... | Say... |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Admin recognition | "This gives you tangible proof of impact to share with your principal." |
| Student outcomes | "Your students get portfolio-ready work they can actually use." |
| Professional growth | "Being featured as a spotlight instructor looks great on your resume." |
| Making their job easier | "You're already doing the work — this just makes it visible." |

---

### 5. Ask for Participation

**The soft ask:**

> "We're rolling this out soon, and I wanted to see if you'd be interested in being one of our first featured instructors. We'd love to use your class as an example of what's possible with PFL Academy."

**If they say yes:**
> "Great! I'll follow up with a few questions for your success story, and we'll get your Impact Report set up as soon as the feature is live."

**If they're hesitant:**
> "No pressure at all. Even if you just want to use the Impact Reports for your own admin conversations, that's totally fine. We just want to give you the tools."

---

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do I have to share my students' work publicly?"**
> A: "Not at all. Everything is opt-in. You can use the Impact Reports privately — just for your admin — without any public visibility. Student showcases only feature work that students (and you) explicitly choose to share."

**Q: "What if my completion rates aren't that high?"**
> A: "The reports are yours — you choose when to generate and share them. And honestly, even modest numbers tell a story. If you had 20 students and 15 completed business plans, that's 15 more than most classes produce."

**Q: "How much extra work is this for me?"**
> A: "Almost none. The data is already there. You'd just choose which student project to highlight and optionally write a quick quote. Five minutes, tops."

**Q: "Will my school be named?"**
> A: "Only if you want. You control what's visible — full name, initials only, school name or just the state. It's your profile."
