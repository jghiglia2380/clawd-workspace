## The Pitch (For Instructors)

> "We're building a **Success Amplification program** designed to showcase instructor and student achievements. This includes student portfolio features where your students' work can be highlighted, instructor spotlights with shareable impact summaries you can present to your administration, and school success stories that make it easy to demonstrate the value of what you're doing in the classroom. We want to make it effortless for you to shine — and in doing so, help other educators discover PFL Academy through your success stories."
