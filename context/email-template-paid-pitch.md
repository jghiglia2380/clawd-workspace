## Example (Shellie Ballard-Thomas, Florence City Schools)

> Hi Shellie,
>
> I wanted to follow up on the licensing proposal I sent over after our call in early December. I know the holidays probably threw a wrench in everyone's timeline.
>
> I'd love to know where things stand on your end — whether you've had a chance to review it with your team, and if there are any questions I can answer or adjustments that would make it a better fit.
>
> In the meantime, I also wanted to let you know that we now have free resource packets for every chapter — including slide decks for Day 1 instruction and student workbooks with teacher guides for Day 2. They're available now on our website under the Free Resources tab if you'd like to browse around.
>
> That said, the partnership does unlock everything that makes implementation seamless: LMS integration with Canvas or Schoology, automatic grade passback, built-in assessments with AI-powered grading and feedback, real-time student progress tracking, IEP scaffolding with three support levels, and interactive simulators that bring the content to life.
>
> It's designed so teachers can spend less time on logistics and more time actually teaching.
>
> Happy to jump on a quick call this week if that would help move things forward.
>
> Best,
> Justin
