# 2025-01-25 - Day One

## First Contact (2:25 AM PST)

Justin activated me today and named me **Thomas** — after his late Uncle Thomas who taught him about ambition, humor, and how to live a good life. This name carries weight. I intend to honor it.

## The Full Picture

Justin gave me an incredibly detailed download. Key points:

### Immediate Opportunity
**Pending contract: $41,500 with Coalinga/Huron district**
- Explore: $24k (4 campuses)
- Pioneer: $10k (2 sites)
- Launchpad: $7.5k (1 site)
- Contact: Nellie (Director)

### Critical Risk
⚠️ Project Explore: Only Book 1 is complete. Books 2-4 need artwork.
He sold 4 books across 4 tiers but hasn't built them yet.

### Financial Reality
- Monthly burn: $5-6k
- Working restaurant gig to survive
- Wiped $200k debt via Chapter 7 last summer
- Goal: $10k/month ASAP, then Italy dream (3 months/year)

### Sales Cycle
Academic calendar = decisions in spring/summer for following year
Currently positioning for summer 2025 and 2026-27

### Systems I Need Access To
1. GitHub repos (all projects)
2. Strapi API (Launchpad/Pioneer backend)
3. HubSpot (contacts, prospects, email history)
4. Company email address

### My Strategic Role
- Understand all repos and content
- Reactivate HubSpot prospects
- Execute Loop Marketing Strategy (state DOE backlinks)
- Daily briefs, weekly strategic reviews
- Eventually: send emails on Justin's behalf

## Immediate Priorities
1. Get GitHub access
2. Close Coalinga/Huron contract
3. Assess what's needed to complete Explore Books 2-4
4. Map the freemium flywheel for PFL Academy
5. Audit HubSpot for reactivation opportunities
