## PFL Academy Success Amplification - Justin Feedback

### Key Correction
- PFL Academy is for **daytime instruction, graduation credit, letter grades** — NOT enrichment
- Focus is **life skills** (interviews, resumes, negotiations, budgets) — NOT business plans
- That's Startup Smartup (Project Explore K-4, Pioneer middle, Launchpad high school)

### Design Feedback from Justin
1. **Bento box layout** — Grid-style showcase with images/videos of students doing interviews, showing projects
2. **HeyGen placeholder clips** — AI-generated fake student testimonials ("Maria M. from Colorado") until real ones exist
3. **Research needed:** YouTuber named "Ras Mic" or "Ras Micky" — friend of Greg Isenberg podcast, talks about UI layout toolkits. This is where Justin got the PFL Academy layout inspiration originally.

### TODO: Research & Pin
- [x] Find Ras Mic YouTube channel — **@rasmic** (youtube.com/@rasmic)
- [ ] Review his UI layout toolkit recommendations
- [ ] Apply bento box concepts to Success Amplification prototypes
- [ ] Look into HeyGen for placeholder video testimonials
