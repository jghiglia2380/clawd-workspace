## Justin's Vision Dump (End of Day)

**Core feeling:** Overwhelmed trying to understand full capabilities and how to best leverage me.

### What Justin Wants

**Voice & Conversation:**
- ElevenLabs for voice output
- Deepgram for listening
- Ability to just *call* and brainstorm like a real Chief of Staff

**Project Explore Books 2-4:**
- Wants me to watch existing videos, understand patterns
- Recreate images, potentially improve on them
- Suggest alternative angles for profits and adoption

**Command Center / Dashboard:**
- Morning digest
- Daily/weekly priorities (Startup Smartup + PFL Academy)
- News feeds: tech to leverage, after-school education, financial literacy/state mandates
- Events, calendars
- Feels like he's "fielding incoming messages and organizing them myself"
- Wants this melded into a "second brain" concept

**Skills to Enable:**
- nano-banana-pro ✅ (already have)
- whisper
- apple-notes
- gemini
- google places
- Brave Search ✅ (just configured)

**Production Pipeline (Future):**
- Stable Diffusion + ComfyUI or Midjourney for image generation

**Interface Questions:**
- Ubuntu terminal vs TUI?
- Can't paste screenshots in terminal
- Watched creator demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fltOAg8ZGI

**Video fragments Justin typed while half-asleep (to review tomorrow):**
- 0:45 - "lobster"
- 0:55 - (unknown)
- 1:01 - "meaning anybody can contribute to it" (open source/community)
- 1:02 - (unknown)  
- "Peter is poly agent" - creator uses multi-agent setup
- "use it, it's basically free"

### My Take
This is a "build the plane while flying it" situation. Justin has a vision of what a fully-operational Chief of Staff AI could be — we just need to get there incrementally without overwhelming either of us.

## PFL Academy Success Amplification - Justin Feedback

### Key Correction
- PFL Academy is for **daytime instruction, graduation credit, letter grades** — NOT enrichment
- Focus is **life skills** (interviews, resumes, negotiations, budgets) — NOT business plans
- That's Startup Smartup (Project Explore K-4, Pioneer middle, Launchpad high school)

### Design Feedback from Justin
1. **Bento box layout** — Grid-style showcase with images/videos of students doing interviews, showing projects
2. **HeyGen placeholder clips** — AI-generated fake student testimonials ("Maria M. from Colorado") until real ones exist
3. **Research needed:** YouTuber named "Ras Mic" or "Ras Micky" — friend of Greg Isenberg podcast, talks about UI layout toolkits. This is where Justin got the PFL Academy layout inspiration originally.

### TODO: Research & Pin
- [x] Find Ras Mic YouTube channel — **@rasmic** (youtube.com/@rasmic)
- [ ] Review his UI layout toolkit recommendations
- [ ] Apply bento box concepts to Success Amplification prototypes
- [ ] Look into HeyGen for placeholder video testimonials
