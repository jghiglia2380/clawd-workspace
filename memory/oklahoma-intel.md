# Oklahoma Intel (from HubSpot emails)

*Extracted: 2025-01-26*

## Timeline

- **Fall 2024**: RFP submission began (Justin missed this deadline)
- **July 2025**: Finalists locked, review underway
- **November 14, 2025**: State Textbook Committee votes on adoption
- **Early 2026**: Contracts finalized with adopted publishers
- **Spring 2026**: Districts review and make local adoption decisions
- **July 2026**: Textbook funds allocated, materials ready
- **2026-27 school year**: New curricula roll out

## Shea McCrary Status

- **On the PFL evaluation committee** (OSDE-trained)
- **Has the selection committee rubric**
- Offered to measure PFL Academy against the official rubric
- Will be presenting to districts across Oklahoma
- Teaching at Muldrow Public Schools (using PFL Academy for free)

### Key Quote from Shea (July 9, 2025):
> "I did learn that the submission of materials and bids began last Fall, so the group of finalists that we are to review is a done deal. Now that I have the selection committee rubric that is being utilized, I would like a little more time to measure your program against that rubric. Fair enough? I feel that would give you further guidance in addition to my 'PFL teacher eyes/brain'"

## Alternative Path (from email analysis)

**Districts CAN choose non-adopted programs:**
> "Districts may utilize other resources beyond those formally adopted if the program demonstrates full alignment to all 14 PFL standards."

**OSDE confirmed this during the 2024-25 bridge year.**

## Known Contenders for Adoption

- Next Gen Personal Finance (NGPF)
- EVERFI
- Dave Ramsey's Foundations in Personal Finance
- NEFE High School Financial Planning Program
- Junior Achievement

## Strategic Implications

1. **PFL Academy missed the formal RFP** but can still win district-by-district
2. **Shea is an inside champion** who can advocate at district presentations
3. **Next submission window**: Fall 2026 for contracts beginning 2027
4. **If adopted next cycle**: On approved list for 6 years (through 2033)

## Action Items
