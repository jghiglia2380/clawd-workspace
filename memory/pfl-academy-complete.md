**Key Contact: Jeff Allen**
- Title: TSA Personal Finance Curriculum, Instruction and Professional Learning
- Organization: Fresno Unified School District
- Works with CDE on curriculum guide
- Phone: (559) 457-3563
- Email: jeff.allen@fresnounified.org

**Relationship Timeline:**
- Nov 2025: Met at Jump$tart Conference (Boston)
- Nov 7: Justin sent demo credentials
- Dec 2025: Jeff explored platform, reached out to CDE
- Dec 2025: **CDE REJECTED** - "potential perception of advertising for paid product"
- Dec 19: Justin responded with updated free resources positioning
- Jan 23: Justin followed up requesting 15-min Zoom

**The Objection:**
CDE requires resources to be "completely free to individual educators and LEAs" - they won't feature anything connected to a paid product, even if free tier exists.

**Justin's Counter:**
Restructured site + free resource library to better align with guidelines. Created standalone 3-part resources (slides, workbooks, guides) with no sales component.

### Other States
- Difficult to connect with DOE directors
- Rarely answer calls or respond to emails
- All concerned about appearing to support paid vendors

## Competitor Intelligence

### NGPF (Next Gen Personal Finance)
**Login credentials:**
- Username: Nbutler
- Password: Teacher2025!

Need to analyze their:
- Content structure
- Free vs paid model
- How they position to DOEs
- Why they get backlinks and PFL doesn't

## Loop Marketing Strategy

### The Four Loops

1. **Teacher-to-District Loop**
   - Teachers use platform → Experience success → Advocate internally → District adopts → More teachers

2. **Student Artifact Loop**
   - Students use skill builders → Create impressive artifacts → Share with parents/counselors → Inquiries to school → New districts

3. **Implementation Data Loop**
   - District implements → Generate success data → District shares publicly → Other districts see evidence

4. **Content Loop**
   - Write Substack → Policy insights resonate → Readers reach out → Conversations → Relationships

### Primary Metric
**WAR (Weekly Active Relationships)** = Districts/schools with meaningful engagement this week
- Target: 3% weekly growth
- Compounding: 3% weekly = 4x annual

### Operating Cadence
- Monday Morning Reset (30 min)
- Wednesday Midweek Velocity Check (15 min)
- Friday Loop Audit (20 min)
- Monthly Strategic Review (60 min)
- Quarterly Strategic Reset (2 hours)

## The Core Problem

**Chicken-and-egg with state DOEs:**
- DOEs won't link to anything perceived as promoting paid products
- But PFL Academy has a paid tier
- Even though free resources are genuinely free and complete
- NGPF somehow gets around this (need to understand how)

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Position free resources as completely separate brand/entity?
2. Find champions who will advocate despite policy concerns
3. Build grassroots teacher adoption that pressures DOEs
4. Content marketing that builds authority without DOE gatekeepers

---

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Follow up with Oklahoma instructors** (10 warm leads)
2. **Jeff Allen response** - did he reply to Jan 23 email?
3. **Connect Supabase to HubSpot** - leads are being lost
4. **Analyze NGPF** - understand competitive positioning
5. **Implement Loop Marketing SOPs** - start tracking WAR
