# 2026-01-26 - Initial Deep Dive with Justin

## Key Business Context Learned

### LMS Integration Status
- **SchoolDay partnership passed** - Built LMS integration in-house instead
- Still open to SchoolDay if there's strategic value later
- **Now have integrations with:**
  - Canvas
  - Clever
  - Other LMS platforms
- This is significant — means Launchpad/Pioneer can integrate directly with schools

### Access Gained
✅ **Microsoft Graph API** - Both domains working
  - Startup Smartup (startupsmartup.com)
  - PFL Academy (pflacademy.co)
✅ **HubSpot API** - Already had, confirmed working

Still need:
- GitHub repos
- Strapi API

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up thomas@startupsmartup.com email identity
- [ ] Add Mail.Send permission for direct email sending

## Key Context from Justin (Late Night Session)

### Current Reality
- Only active Startup Smartup site is through Nexplore (contract work)
- Most Strapi data is old/test accounts from over the years
- Working restaurant 2-3 nights/week to make ends meet
- Nexplore contract work also helping with cash flow
- Chapter 7 bankruptcy summer 2024 cleared $200k credit card debt
- Deal flow dry — focused on product development (Explore, PFL Academy)
- PFL Academy uses **Supabase** for backend

### Nexplore Relationship
- Contract client, Justin doing production work
- Key contacts: Dori, Raya (Director of Curriculum), Vanesa (Office Manager, payments)
- Working on "Project Pioneer"
- Recent payment discussion (Jan 23) — ACH to Start Smart account

### What Justin Needs from Me
1. Complete onboarding/configuration (email identity, full system access)
2. Daily/weekly/monthly rhythms to stay on top of everything
3. Podcast/content summarization to stay informed without drowning
4. Revenue generation support — inbound traffic, marketing, opportunity detection
5. Industry monitoring — RFPs, mandates, conferences, outreach timing
6. Synthesize chaos into structured action

### Seb Call Outcome (10 AM PST)
- **Balance owed:** ~$5k — big requests on hold until paid up
- **Rate increase:** $25/hr → $30/hr (first increase since 2013!)
- **Relationship:** Good, professional — completely reasonable ask
- **Architecture notes:** Still coming via email
- **Games section spec:** Must be built in Vue + TypeScript
- **Bitbucket/Supabase access:** On hold until balance cleared

**Implication:** Revenue is job #1. Need to generate cash to unlock dev support.

### The Vision
- Justin believes he can hit 7 figures given market mandates, competition, product quality
- My job: help him get there
- Created ROADMAP.md to track everything
