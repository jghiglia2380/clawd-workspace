## Timeline

## Context

- Using ELOP (Expanded Learning Opportunities Program) funds
- District manages funds, had to add staff positions first
- Hiring process now finalized
- Waiting on budget rollout for clarity
- Nellie says it's temporary, not a cancellation

## Risk Assessment

- ✅ Nellie confirmed it's just a timing issue
- ✅ She's still interested in Project Explore K-4
- ⚠️ No signed PO yet — not guaranteed
- ⚠️ Budget rebalancing could reduce scope

## Production Economics (Project Explore)

Artist (Egypt): 
- $3,000 per book (all 4 tiers, 20 scenes)
- $1,500 additional for post-production (ElevenLabs, stitching, captions, thumbnails)
- **$4,500 total per book**

Current state:
- Book 1: COMPLETE
- Books 2-4: Need production = $13,500 total cost
- Revenue from Explore: $24,000
- **Net on Explore: $10,500** (plus Pioneer/Launchpad margins)

Spanish versions: May require Justin's involvement

## Action Items

- [ ] Follow up with Nellie first week of February
- [ ] Prepare Project Explore demo for K-4
