## 🎯 TOP PRIORITY

**Education Department funding stabilizes** — Bipartisan agreement reached on FY26 budget, rejecting Trump admin plans to gut the department. This means federal education funding pathways remain intact for now. Good news for any district-level sales conversations.

## 📚 FINANCIAL LITERACY LANDSCAPE

### Policy & Regulation
- **Minimum wage changes** — Multiple states raised minimum wages Jan 1, 2025 (NGPF tracking this for curriculum). Relevant for PFL Academy's budgeting chapters.
- **School choice expanding** — Private school choice programs using taxpayer funds continuing to grow. May affect district budgets for curriculum purchases.

### Competitor Watch: NGPF
- **Podcast drop**: Interview with Mellody Hobson (Ariel Investments) — high-profile guest suggests they're investing in thought leadership
- **Content machine active**: Daily "Question of the Day" blog posts, Math Monday series, FinCap Friday
- **Free model working**: Heavy push for teacher account signups with verification process
- **Takeaway**: NGPF continues teacher-community-first strategy. PFL Academy's differentiation = AI practice scenarios, integrated gradebook, premium support
